      <p>Behind the bustle of the Quicksand, Momodi leans in close and asks if she can rely on your discretion before lowering her voice. To the outside world, Ul’dah presents itself as a sultanate ruled by Her Majesty Nanamo Ul Namo, yet in truth the city-state is steered by its six richest citizens, the Syndicate. Even so, the sultana still has the people’s hearts—hearts that could turn away if a certain scandal were to come to light. In a pained whisper, Momodi reveals that the royal crown, symbol of the dynasty itself, has been stolen from the palace. The Sultansworn charged with guarding it that night, a man named Owyne, now bears the brunt of the blame. The letter you recovered, she suspects, was penned by the very thieves who took the crown, addressed to Owyne at this of all times. She presses the missive into your hands and urges you to seek him out in the Heart of the Sworn, using her name as your pass. At Scholars’ Walk, a Sultansworn Elite challenges you, only to tense at the mention of a “lost heirloom” and grudgingly allow you inside. Owyne receives you politely enough, but when he reads the letter his composure falters. He assumes Momodi has explained how grave the theft is for Her Grace, and admits that the shame rests on him—he grew careless, lulled by peace, and allowed the crown to be taken on his watch. Since that moment, the Sultansworn have searched in vain for a trace of the thieves, until this ransom note finally named a price and a place. The criminals demand payment in exchange for the crown’s return. Knowing what the crown means—proof of Nanamo’s birthright and her role as custodian of the Ul legacy—Owyne feels he has no choice but to accede. He will go to a place called the Unholy Heir to pay the ransom, yet he dares not face notorious criminals alone. Nor can he march in with a full company of Sultansworn without scaring them off. With a heavy sigh, he appeals to you by name: the adventurer whom Momodi praises without end. On behalf of all who remain loyal to the sultana, he begs you to stand at his side during the exchange.</p>
      <p>You travel with Owyne to the Unholy Heir, a quiet basin in central Thanalan where a great stone rises from shallow waters. There, in the shadow of the rock, Owyne calls out and demands to see the crown. Geribald, leader of the outlaws, appears and coolly insists that Owyne will have it—once they are properly compensated. Owyne snaps back, asking how he can trust men who stole from the crown to honor any bargain. Geribald only laughs, pointing out that of all present, Owyne is the least trustworthy: the crown was stolen on his watch, and now he has even broken the condition to come alone. With you beside him, what guarantee do the bandits have that archers are not lurking in the hills, ready to loose the moment the crown is shown? Accusing Owyne of making a mockery of their trust, Geribald declares the deal off. Desperate, Owyne thrusts forward the payment they demanded. The bandit sniffs the vial and his eyes glitter—’tis the true substance. In a shrill cackle, he thanks Owyne for succeeding where so many thieves failed, exulting that they now possess the Traders’ Spurn, a dread concoction said to grant them the power to raise an army of undying soldiers and bring the doom of Sil’dih upon the land. Horror-struck, Owyne realizes too late what he has delivered into their hands and cries out in despair. Geribald taunts him, asking whether he truly thought they were being generous by setting their price equal to the worth of a royal crown. With their prize secure, they draw weapons and promise to grant Owyne a swift death as a mercy for the ruin he has wrought. Surrounded by foes, Owyne urges you to flee while he holds the line, insisting he will fulfill his duty even if it costs his life. Before he can charge, an aged voice cuts through the chaos: Papashan, clad once more in armor, strides into the fray with a detachment of Sultansworn at his back. He reminds Owyne that a Sultansworn’s duty is to serve the sultana—and that duty will keep the younger man alive for many years yet. At his command, the Sultansworn draw their blades, Papashan orders them to cut down the thieves and secure the crown, and the battlefield erupts into steel and shouting as you join the fight for Ul’dah’s honor.</p>
      <p>When the dust settles, Owyne stares at Papashan in stunned disbelief, unable to understand how his old mentor came to be here. Papashan explains that the Flame General saw Owyne slip into the vaults and suspected mischief; Raubahn quietly ordered Papashan and the Sultansworn to keep watch. Even as Owyne struggles to grasp that the Flame General had been looking out for him, a breathless Sultansworn Elite reports that more thieves are fleeing to the north with the crown. Papashan immediately orders a pursuit, declaring that the band you faced was only a diversion. As the Sultansworn race off, Owyne asks that you speak again back in the city, then hurries after them. Before you can withdraw, the masked mage you crossed paths with before steps from the shadows, his presence staining the air. Observing the battle’s aftermath, he declares that the source of your strength is now clear and that you have become a threat to “the plan” that cannot be allowed to live. Raising his staff, he chants an invocation to the abyss, calling forth a voidsent to smite his enemies. Another brutal struggle ensues at the Unholy Heir, your blows ringing against the creature’s hide as the mage exults and curses in turn. Just as he unleashes fresh venom and scorn, Thancred arrives with a wry remark about your talent for finding trouble, joining the battle at your side. The masked mage marvels at your preternatural might, insisting no mortal should wield such strength, but his disbelief avails him nothing; together, you and Thancred bring him low. As he lies defeated, the mage mutters that the wisdom of the Paragons has been humbled by mere mortals, confirming what the Sharlayan had feared: the so-called Bringers of Chaos, the Ascians, are indeed moving against the sultanate.</p>
      <p>In the aftermath, Thancred speaks of Ascians and aetheric disturbances before catching himself—he does not recall telling you of his Sharlayan homeland, yet you already knew. With a knowing look he realizes you are one of the gifted, one blessed—or burdened—with the Echo. Lightening the mood, he notes that this is the third time he has found you at the heart of some calamity; if he did not know better, he would call you a lodestone for trouble. Half-jesting that perhaps he should simply follow you to uncover the next grand conspiracy, he nonetheless apologizes for arriving late to your aid. Still, the masked foe is slain, and though Thancred doubts this will be the last Ascian you face, he believes his death will at least grant Ul’dah a brief respite. With that, duty pulling him onward, he bids you farewell until next time and departs. You return to Ul’dah, where a Sultansworn Elite on Scholars’ Walk tells you that everyone awaits you in the Heart of the Sworn. Inside, Owyne thanks you from the bottom of his heart for defending the sultana’s good name and sparing the Sultansworn further disgrace, then yields the floor to Papashan. The old stationmaster appears in full regalia and gently asks if his martial attire surprises you. He confides that he once served as a Sultansworn himself, laying down his sword fifteen years ago to become stationmaster, a post in which he remains proud to serve. Whenever Her Majesty leaves the safety of the palace, it is he who guards her person. Never had he seen Nanamo so despondent as when news of the crown’s theft reached her—but thanks to your courage, she has regained her former vitality. For that, he says, every Sultansworn owes you a debt of gratitude.</p>
      <p>Soon after, you are summoned to the royal hall. In a resplendent ceremony, a lady-in-waiting proclaims the arrival of Her Royal Majesty Nanamo Ul Namo, seventeenth ascendant to the throne of Ul’dah and exalted vessel of Nald’thal, as the Sultansworn cry out their devotion. The tiny sultana regards you warmly, saying she has heard tales of a champion among champions whose tireless service to the crown merits the highest honor they can bestow—and that she never dreamed that champion would be you. At her command, a treasured gift is brought forth as a token of the realm’s gratitude and esteem. Raubahn Aldynn steps forward at her side, addressed simply as “Your Grace” before she instructs him to see that you attend the coming banquet as her personal guest. After accepting the order, Raubahn turns to you with measured respect, noting that if all he has heard is true, Ul’dah owes you a great debt. Strange, he muses, that your paths have not crossed until today, for he senses that you are kindred spirits whose stories belong in the same saga. Introducing himself as the man who oversees the sultanate’s affairs with Her Grace’s blessing, he observes that brave souls are scarce in these troubled times and counts his blessings for having found one in you. He looks forward to seeing you at the banquet and, together with the assembled Sultansworn, offers a final blessing: for the sake of Nanamo and the glory of the sultanate, may you walk in the light of the Crystal.</p>

      <p>酒場クイックサンドの喧噪の奥で、モモディはあなたを手招きし、小声で口止めを求めてから、こっそりと事情を打ち明ける。世間では、ウルダハはナナモ・ウル・ナモ陛下が治める「女王の都」として知られている。だが実際には、莫大な富を持つ6人の顔役たち「砂蠍衆」が実権を握っており、彼らの合議なくしては政治は動かない。それでもなお、ナナモ女王は民衆からの支持を失ってはいない……少なくとも、今はまだ。しかし、ある事件が公になれば、そのわずかな信頼でさえ揺らぐかもしれないのだと、モモディは苦い表情で続ける。王家の象徴たる「王冠」が、王宮から盗まれてしまったのである。その夜、王冠の警護を任されていた銀冑団の騎士オワインは、今や全ての責めを負わされている。あなたが預かった手紙は、おそらく王冠を奪った賊どもが送ってきた「取引の書状」に違いない──しかも、よりによってこのタイミングで、オワイン宛に。モモディは封書をあなたに託し、自分の名を出せば案内してもらえるはずだと告げて、「銀冑団総長室」のあるフロンデール歩廊へ向かってほしいと頼み込む。スカラーズウォークに立つ銀冑団の近衛騎士は、最初こそあなたを不審者扱いするが、「失われた至宝」に関する使いだと知るや態度を改め、中へと通す。銀冑団総長室で対面したオワインは、はじめは礼儀正しく応じるものの、封書に目を通した途端、顔色を曇らせる。モモディから王冠の重要性、そしてその喪失が女王陛下にもたらす打撃について聞かされているだろう、と前置きしたうえで、彼はこの失態の責任が自分にあることを認める。日々の平穏に慣れ、警備を疎かにしたわずかな隙を突かれてしまったのだ、と悔しげに語るオワインは、盗難の発生以来、銀冑団総出で王冠の行方を追ってきたが、何ひとつ手がかりを掴めなかったことも打ち明ける。そんな折に届いたのが、あなたが運んできた身代金の要求──王冠を返す代わりに、ある品を指定の場所で引き渡せという内容だった。王家の血統と「ウル家」の正統なる継承者を示す証である王冠は、必ず取り戻さねばならない。そう語るオワインは、自らアンホーリーエアーへ赴き、賊どもと取引する覚悟を決めていた。ただし、相手はウルダハでも名の知れた無法者たちであり、要求どおりひとりきりで向かうのはあまりに危険だ。かといって、銀冑団の一隊を率いて行けば、賊を刺激してしまうかもしれない。悩んだ末、オワインはモモディが信頼を寄せる冒険者──あなたの力を頼ることにする。ナナモ女王陛下を敬愛する者たちを代表して、どうか取引の場に同道してほしい、と深く頭を下げて懇願するのだった。</p>
      <p>こうして、あなたはオワインと共に中央ザナラーンの「アンホーリーエアー」へ向かう。浅い水面に巨大な岩がそびえる静かな一角で、オワインは姿なき賊に向かって王冠の受け渡しを求める。やがて現れた無法者たちの頭目ゲリバルドは、王冠が欲しければ、まずは代価を支払えと冷ややかに告げる。オワインは、王冠を盗んだ張本人たちをどう信用しろというのかと食ってかかるが、ゲリバルドは鼻で笑い返す。王冠を盗まれたうえ、今回の取り決めさえ守れなかったお前こそ、一番信用ならない男だろう、と。取引の条件は「ひとりで来ること」だったはずだ、とゲリバルドは続け、あなたの存在を指し示す。もし周囲の岩陰に弓兵の一隊でも潜んでいるとしたら、王冠を見せた瞬間に矢の雨を浴びせられるかもしれない──そう疑ってもおかしくはない状況だ、と非難するゲリバルドは、「信頼を踏みにじられた」として取引の中止を宣言する。追い詰められたオワインは、必死に懐から差し出された品を掲げる。賊が求めたのは、王宮秘蔵の禁薬「ゾンビパウダー」、すなわち「トレーダース・スパーン」と呼ばれる危険な薬品だった。ゲリバルドは匂いを確かめ、目を細めると、甲高い笑い声を上げて本物であることを確信する。数多の盗賊が手に入れられなかった秘薬を、こうも容易く運び込んでくれたとオワインを嘲り、「これでついに、不死の軍勢を作り出す力を手にした」と歓喜するゲリバルドは、シラディハに再び滅びをもたらしてくれると叫ぶ。自分が何を渡してしまったのかを悟ったオワインは絶望に打ちのめされ、膝を折りそうになりながらも、自分の愚かさを呪うしかない。そんな彼に対し、ゲリバルドは、王冠と同じ価値を持つ代価を差し出させておいて、慈善心など期待していたのかと問い詰め、最後には「自ら招いたシラディハの再滅亡に責任を取らせてやる」と言い放って剣を抜く。包囲されたオワインは、あなたに向かって走れと叫び、自分はここで職務を全うするのだと覚悟を決めようとするが、その瞬間、懐かしい老騎士の声が戦場に響く。かつての上官パパシャンが、銀冑団の騎士たちを率いて現れたのだ。パパシャンは、銀冑団の務めは女王陛下に仕えることだと諭し、「その務めは、まだまだこれから果たしてもらわねばならん」とオワインに告げる。老騎士の号令一下、銀冑団は一斉に剣を抜き、賊どもを討ち、王冠を奪還せよと叫ぶパパシャンの声とともに、アンホーリーエアーの静寂は鋼と怒号の響きに塗り替えられていく。</p>
      <p>激闘の末、無法者たちは地に伏し、ようやく戦いはひとまずの決着を見る。オワインは、なぜパパシャンがここにいるのかと驚愕し、言葉を失う。パパシャンは静かに事情を明かす。オワインが密かに宝物庫へ出入りしていることに気付いたラウバーン将軍が、不穏な気配を感じ取り、パパシャンたちにオワインの行動を見張るよう命じていたのだ。自分のためにまで目を光らせていたのかと知り、オワインは混乱しながらも将軍の配慮に胸を突かれる。そこへ、北方で新たな賊の気配を察知した銀冑団の近衛騎士が駆け込んできて、王冠を奪った一味が逃走中だと報告する。パパシャンは、この場の賊はあくまで時間稼ぎに過ぎなかったと見抜き、銀冑団に追撃を命じる。オワインは、詳しい話は後で街に戻ってからとあなたに告げると、仲間たちの後を追って駆け出していく。その場に一人残ったあなたの前に、かつて対峙した仮面の魔道士が再び姿を現す。戦いの余韻を冷ややかに眺めながら、彼はあなたの力の源がようやく見えてきたと呟き、「計画」を脅かす存在は生かしておけないと宣言する。やがて、彼は杖を掲げ、深淵に呼びかける呪文を唱え、奈落の従僕たる妖異を召喚してあなたを葬ろうとする。再び苛烈な戦いが始まり、毒と闇に満ちた攻撃が飛び交う中、仮面の魔道士は嘲笑と罵声を浴びせ続ける。その最中、「本当に厄介ごとを呼び寄せるのが得意だな」とでも言いたげな軽口とともにサンクレッドが駆けつけ、共に剣を振るう。仮面の魔道士は、常人とは思えぬあなたの力に驚愕し、「こんな力を持つ者がいるはずがない」と叫ぶが、抵抗も空しく、あなたとサンクレッドの連携の前に膝を折る。倒れ伏しながら、彼は「パラゴンたちの叡智が、凡百の人の手に打ち砕かれた」と呻き、アシエンたちの暗躍をほのめかして息絶える。</p>
      <p>戦いの後、サンクレッドはアシエンや霊脈の乱れについて口にしながら、ふと自分がシャーレアン出身であることを話した覚えがないのに、あなたがその事実を知っていることに気付く。そこでようやく、あなたが「見えざる力」を持つ存在──「エコー」を授かった者であると悟り、目を細めるサンクレッド。彼は、これであなたと顔を合わせるのは三度目だと指折り数えながら、どこへ行っても厄介事の中心にいるあなたは、まるで騒ぎを引き寄せる磁石のようだと冗談めかして笑う。半ば本気で、いっそ後を付けて回った方が陰謀の尻尾を掴みやすいかもしれない、と茶化しつつも、今回の件に介入するのが遅れたことを詫び、「ともあれ仮面の魔道士は倒れた。奴の同胞が動きを止めるとは思えないが、それでもしばしの猶予は得られたはずだ」と締めくくる。そして、彼自身にも果たすべき任務があると告げ、次に再会する日までの無事を祈りながら去っていく。あなたがウルダハへ戻ると、スカラーズウォークに立つ銀冑団の近衛騎士が、総長室で皆が待っていると声をかける。銀冑団総長室でオワインは、女王陛下の名誉を守り、銀冑団にこれ以上の汚名を背負わせずに済んだことに深い感謝を捧げると、パパシャンに話を譲る。操車場の駅長として見慣れた男は、かつて銀冑団の一員として剣を取っていた頃と同じ甲冑に身を包み、十五年前に剣を置いてからも、駅長という立場で女王陛下に仕えてきたのだと語る。女王陛下が外出される際には、その身辺の護衛を任されるのも自分の役目であり、王冠盗難の報せを受けたときのナナモの沈んだ表情は、これまで一度も見たことがないほどだったと振り返る。だが、あなたの活躍によって王冠は取り戻され、再び笑顔を取り戻した女王陛下の姿を見られたことに、パパシャンは心からの安堵を滲ませる。そして、銀冑団一同を代表して、あなたへの深い感謝の言葉を述べるのだった。</p>
      <p>やがて、あなたは王宮の謁見の間へと招かれる。侍女の声が荘厳に響き渡り、「ナナモ・ウル・ナモ陛下、ナルザルの加護を受けしウルダハ第十七代の女王がご入場」と宣言されると、銀冑団の騎士たちが「ナナモ万歳！ 女王陛下に栄光あれ！」と声を合わせる。玉座に座す小さな女王は、まずあなたをじっと見つめ、数々の働きによって王冠を救い出した「勇士の中の勇士」の噂を聞いていたこと、その者に授け得る最高の栄誉を用意していたが、まさかそれがあなたであったとは夢にも思わなかったことを告げる。そして合図とともに、女王とウルダハの感謝と敬意を示す贈り物が運び出される。女王の傍らには、東アルデナード商会総帥にして不滅隊の最高司令官ラウバーン・アルディンが控えており、女王は彼に、あなたを晩餐会の「特別な客」としてもてなすよう命じる。ラウバーンは恭しく命を受けると、あなたへ向き直り、その武勲によってウルダハがどれほどの恩義を負ったかを語る。これほどの大事になるまで顔を合わせてこなかったのは不思議な縁だとしながらも、彼はあなたにどこか「同じ物語を歩む者」の気配を感じると言い、自らの名と、ナナモ陛下の許しを得てウルダハ政庁の諸事を預かる立場であることを明かす。乱世にあって真の勇気を持つ者は少ないが、その中でもあなたと出会えたことを幸運に思うと告げ、晩餐会での再会を楽しみにしていると微笑む。最後に、集った銀冑団の声に送られながら、ラウバーンはナナモ陛下のために、そしてウルダハの栄光のために、「クリスタルの加護とともに歩まんことを」とあなたの前途を祝福するのだった。</p>

      <p>在 Quicksand 熙來攘往的人群背後，Momodi 把你拉到一旁，先確認你願意保守秘密，才壓低聲音說起真正的情況。表面上，Ul’dah 是由女王 Nanamo Ul Namo 所統治的王國，但實際掌權的，卻是由六位大富豪組成的 Syndicate。即便如此，女王仍擁有民眾的支持──至少目前還是。不過，一旦某件醜聞被公開，就連這份來之不易的信任也可能瞬間瓦解。Momodi 痛心地告訴你，象徵王室血脈的王冠，已經從王宮中被竊，而當晚負責守護王冠的 Sultansworn 騎士 Owyne，如今成了眾矢之的。她懷疑，你從賊人手中取得的那封信，正是犯人寄給 Owyne、要求進行交易的勒索信，而且偏偏選在這種時機投遞。Momodi 將信件交給你，請你前往 Scholars’ Walk 的 Heart of the Sworn，帶著她的名字去找 Owyne，並表示這是關於「失落的王室至寶」的要事。通道前的 Sultansworn Elite 起初嚴詞攔下你，但一聽到「失竊的傳家寶」便立刻收起態度，讓你通過。面對面時，Owyne 先是客氣地詢問你的來意，接過信後讀到一半，臉色便沉重了下來。他推測 Momodi 已經向你說明王冠的重大意義，以及失竊對女王名譽造成的打擊，接著坦承這一切都是自己的責任──因為自己因為長期安穩鬆懈了戒心，才會在警備上留下破綻。自從王冠失竊，Sultansworn 便不斷追查賊人的下落，卻始終一無所獲，直到這封勒索信送到手上，才第一次看見線索。信中載明，犯人願意歸還王冠，但必須用另一件同等價值的物品作為交換，並指定在 Unholy Heir 完成交涉。Owyne 深知，王冠象徵著 Nanamo 的王位正統，也是她作為 Ul 王室守護者的印記，無論如何都必須找回來。雖然明白對方是惡名昭彰的盜賊，他仍決定親自前往 Unholy Heir 赴約。然而，要他孤身面對這些罪犯風險太大，若又帶著一整隊 Sultansworn 出面，很可能嚇跑對方。思量再三，他最終選擇向 Momodi 口中的「值得信賴的冒險者」求助──也就是你。他鄭重地請你在交涉時陪同在側，代表所有仍忠於女王的人，向你懇求協助。</p>
      <p>你與 Owyne 一同前往中央 Thanalan 的 Unholy Heir，那是一處淺水環繞、巨石聳立的寂靜盆地。Owyne 站在水邊高聲呼喚，要求賊人現身並展示王冠。很快地，盜賊頭目 Geribald 帶著手下現身，冷冷地表示，只要他們先拿到交換的代價，王冠自然會交還。Owyne 憤然反問，王冠本來就是從他們手中被偷走的，這樣的人又憑什麼保證信守承諾。Geribald 卻反過來譏笑，說在場最不值得信任的人其實正是 Owyne──王冠是在他負責守衛時被偷走的，現在連「獨自前來」這項約定也違反了。Geribald 指出你就在他身旁，質疑是否還有一整隊弓兵埋伏在岩石後頭，只等看見王冠就箭雨齊發。在他看來，Owyne 已經徹底踐踏了他們僅存的信任，因此當場宣布交易作廢。走投無路之下，Owyne 只得把犯人要求的「支付物」拿出來。那是一瓶來自王宮、被稱為 Traders’ Spurn 的禁忌藥品，能夠將死者變成不死的怪物。Geribald 嗅了嗅瓶中的氣味，露出滿意的眼神，接著放聲大笑，稱讚 Owyne 成功完成了過去多少盜賊都辦不到的事──把王朝秘藏的禁藥親手送到他們手裡。他興奮地宣稱，現在他們終於掌握了打造不死軍隊的力量，足以將 Sil’dih 再度推向滅亡。意識到自己究竟交出去的是什麼，Owyne 彷彿被雷擊中般呆立當場，只能在悔恨中喃喃自語。Geribald 趁勢嘲諷，問他難道真以為，對方會出於慈善，願意用與王冠等值的代價做交換？如今目的已達，盜賊們拔出武器，聲稱會給 Owyne 一個「痛快」的死，讓他用生命來贖罪。敵人蜂擁而上時，Owyne 要你趕緊逃走，說自己會留在原地履行身為 Sultansworn 的職責。就在這時，一聲熟悉的低沉喊聲打斷了絕望的局勢──Papashan 穿著騎士鎧甲，率領數名 Sultansworn 由遠處急馳而來。他斥責 Owyne 的沖動，提醒他真正的職責是為女王效命，而這份職責並不會在此終結。Papashan 一聲令下，Sultansworn 紛紛拔劍，誓言斬殺盜賊並奪回王冠，於是原本寂靜的 Unholy Heir 在下一瞬間化作鋼鐵碰撞與怒吼交織的戰場，你也拔劍投入戰局。</p>
      <p>戰鬥結束後，盜賊們倒臥在地，Owyne 則滿臉難以置信地望著 Papashan，不明白他為何會出現在這裡。Papashan 平靜地說明，Flame General Raubahn 早就注意到 Owyne 暗自進出寶物庫的行動，感到事有蹊蹺，因此命他與其他 Sultansworn 暗中監視。一想到自己不僅沒有被放棄，甚至還被將軍如此關心，Owyne 一時之間無法言語。這時，一名 Sultansworn Elite 匆忙趕到，報告說有更多盜賊正從北方撤退，手中很可能帶著王冠。Papashan 立刻下令追擊，指出這一群人只是為了拖延時間的誘餌。Owyne 轉身前去支援同伴前，匆匆對你說，希望回到城裡之後能再好好談談。你還來不及應聲，曾在 Sil’dih 發動石像襲擊的那名 Masked Mage 便悄然現身，語氣陰冷地評論著這場戰鬥的結果。他說，現在已經看清你力量的源頭，而你的存在已經足以威脅到「計畫」，因此不能再讓你活下去。說完，他舉起法杖，以 Ascians 的語言向深淵祈禱，召喚出新的 voidsent 作為殺戮的走狗。於是，第二場惡戰在 Unholy Heir 展開，毒液與黑暗法術在水邊四散，Masked Mage 一邊施放詛咒，一邊以狂妄的語氣嘲笑你。然而，很快地，一道熟悉的聲音插入戰局──Thancred 用半開玩笑的口吻說，你還真是擅長把自己丟進麻煩之中，說著便拔劍加入你這一邊。Masked Mage 驚愕於你展現出的異常力量，喊著「凡人不該擁有這種力量」，但他的抗議沒有改變結果。你和 Thancred 聯手擊潰 voidsent，也讓 Masked Mage 自己重傷倒地。臨死前，他喃喃提到 Paragons 的智慧竟然敗在普通凡人手上，證實了 Ascians 的介入與陰謀。</p>
      <p>事後，Thancred 提到 Ascians 與 aether 異常流動的關聯，說著說著卻突然停下，意識到自己從未向你提過自己來自 Sharlayan，卻早已被你道破。他很快聯想到你的「天賦」，認定你是擁有 Echo 的「gifted」，帶著既驚訝又讚賞的神情看著你。接著他半是調侃地說，這已經是第三次在亂局中心遇到你了，若不是親眼所見，幾乎會懷疑你是不是用某種方式把麻煩吸了過來。雖然嘴上說著乾脆乾脆一直跟著你行動，說不定更容易挖出陰謀的真相，但他也坦白這次到場的時間太晚，沒能在一開始就出手幫忙。不過總而言之，Masked Mage 已經被消滅，即便不代表 Ascians 的威脅就此終結，至少也為 Ul’dah 爭取到一點喘息的時間。說完，他表示自己還有其他任務在身，只能先告辭，期待下次再會。你返回 Ul’dah，在 Scholars’ Walk 上遇見的 Sultansworn Elite 告訴你，眾人已在 Heart of the Sworn 等候。進入總長室後，Owyne 向你深深一鞠躬，感謝你守護了女王的名聲，也讓 Sultansworn 免於更大的恥辱，接著讓出位置，將話題交給 Papashan。你眼前的 Papashan 不再是站在操車場、笑臉迎人的老車站長，而是重新披上舊日鎧甲的老騎士。他說，自己曾是 Sultansworn，一直到十五年前才放下長劍，改任 stationmaster，但他並沒有因此遠離職責。每當女王離開王宮，他就會以護衛身分守在她身旁。聽聞王冠遭竊時，Nanamo 的神情從未如此低落，而如今，正因為你奮不顧身的行動，王冠才得以歸位，女王也重拾笑容。Papashan 說，代表全體 Sultansworn，向你表示由衷的感激。</p>
      <p>不久之後，你被召喚前往王宮的謁見大廳。一名 lady-in-waiting 以莊嚴的聲音宣告：「受 Nald’thal 庇佑、守護 Thanalan、Ul’dah 第十七代女王殿下──Nanamo Ul Namo 陛下駕到！」大廳裡的 Sultansworn 齊聲高呼「Nanamo 萬歲！光耀女王！永世長存！」。身形嬌小的女王端坐於王座上，目光溫柔地注視著你。她說，早已聽聞有一位「冠中之冠」般的勇士，為王冠與王國立下赫赫戰功，值得授予王國所能給出的最高殊榮，卻未曾想過，那個人竟會是你。隨著她的命令，一份象徵感謝與敬意的禮物被恭敬地端到你面前。其後，Raubahn Aldynn 走上前來，應女王之喚答以「Your Grace」，聽令確保你成為即將舉辦的宴會上的「貴賓」。在接受命令之後，他轉身對你說，如果所有傳聞屬實，那麼 Ul’dah 確實欠你一份難以估量的恩情。雖然直到今日你們才第一次正面相識，但他感覺你們彷彿同屬一段共同的傳奇。Raubahn 自報姓名，說明自己在女王授意下負責管理 sultanate 的政務，並指出在這樣的時局裡，真正勇敢的人寥寥無幾，因此能遇見你這樣的冒險者，是他極為珍視的幸運。他期待在宴會上再次與你相會，最後與眾 Sultansworn 一同向你獻上祝福：為了女王的安危與 Ul’dah 的榮耀，願你永遠行走在水晶所帶來的光輝之中。</p>
