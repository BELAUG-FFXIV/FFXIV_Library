    story:`<div class="clamp" data-collapsed="true">
<p>Cyr, already at the end of his patience, first makes one thing plain: you do agree that Gigi is a mammet, yes? You do not honestly believe otherwise? Before you can answer, Nashu hurriedly insists that the boy surely did not mean what he said about his “Papa Hildy.” The only explanation, she gasps, is that he must think she is his mama. Hildibrand, however, takes it as a simple case of youthful rebellion. The road of fatherhood was never meant to be smooth, he declares; as guardian of Gigi and doting parent extraordinaire, he will overcome this trial and be reconciled with his beloved son. Nashu agrees with bright enthusiasm: a man who has unmasked thieves, defeated duelists, and led armies of the undead can surely solve a little family trouble. Cyr cuts the talk short. Whatever they call Gigi, he is a mammet of suspicious origin and he has disappeared. If he has left Ishgard, they must learn where he went without delay. Cyr lays out a clear plan: he himself will question the sentries at the Arc of the Worthy, Hildibrand and Nashu will make inquiries at the airship landing, and you are to speak with the guard at the city gate near the manufactory. When each task is done, everyone is to regroup at the gate and share their findings.</p>
<p>At Foundation’s gate, the guard you question remembers a small figure in a wide-brimmed hat who came through not long ago and purchased passage on a supply ship bound for Falcon’s Nest. Another soldier, flustered, stumbles over his own words about Lalafell-sized folk before awkwardly correcting himself. When you return to the appointed spot, Cyr reports that no one matching Gigi’s description passed through the main gates, and Hildibrand says the sentries at the airship landing likewise saw no such passenger. With your report, the only solid lead is the supply ship to Falcon’s Nest. Cyr complains at the thought of returning to that freezing outpost, but Hildibrand is undeterred. Wherever Gigi goes, he declares, he will follow, find him, and embrace him as his son once more. Cyr, thinking back to the vase Gigi mended and the way the mammet reacted afterward, voices a different theory: perhaps Gigi remembered what he is and why he was created, and returned to western Coerthas—a notorious breeding ground for heresy—to deliver what he has learned to his supposed masters. To him, the boy’s departure smells strongly of heresy. Hildibrand instead insists that Gigi must simply want to cast aside his worries and frolic in the snow. Nashu listens to both, but follows as the group sets out for Coerthas.</p>
<p>In the snows of Riversmeet, Hildibrand suddenly stops and points out a line of tiny footprints in the fresh white. He says he would know those footprints anywhere; to him, they clearly belong to Gigi. Nashu leans in and exclaims that even the tracks are adorable, almost like those of a clockwork minion. The prints lead north along the river. Cyr sees them as proof that the mammet left the outpost and headed straight into the wilderness, no doubt towards heretics. Nashu pushes back, insisting that if their “little girl” ran into any such folk, she would simply tell them she wants none of it. Then she recalls having told Gigi that Grandpapa Godbert might like to see his “trick.” Perhaps, she suggests, Gigi came here to find him. Hildibrand eagerly seizes on this idea; of course his son would wish to meet his grandparents. Cyr dryly notes that the same child recently shouted that Hildibrand was not his father, but there is little point in arguing. The tracks continue, and the group follows them north through the snow.</p>
<p>There, lying motionless in the drift, they find the mammet. Gigi is sprawled on his back, his cap crusted with fragments of ice as if struck by something small and fast. Nearby, steinbocks lie dead with similar marks from snowballs. When Gigi stirs, groaning that his head hurts, he recognizes you and realizes you followed him all this way. Hildibrand interprets the scene as the aftermath of an over-enthusiastic snowball fight and says that if Gigi wanted to play with his grandparents, he should have said so sooner—Papa Hildy was worried. Cyr looks from the fallen beasts to the mammet and questions whether he is truly undamaged. Hildibrand dismisses the concern, boasting that being driven headfirst into the earth a few dozen times has never dulled his own wits. Cyr begins to remark on the earth’s opinion, but then notices everyone’s gaze shift over his shoulder. Turning, he finds Godbert standing there, greeting the group cheerfully and apologizing for not having noticed sooner because he was engrossed in a duel with Julyan. He even invites them to join in. Gigi, however, calls out to “Grandpapa Godbert” and repeats what Nashu told him: that his grandfather’s hammer is said to wield the powers of life and death. He begs to be granted life and made a real boy.</p>
<p>Godbert asks if he is truly sure; it may hurt. Gigi answers that he will endure whatever he must to become a real boy. At that, Godbert lifts his hammer, calls upon Byregot to guide his hand, and sets to work. When he is done, Gigi stands in a new body of flesh and blood, exclaiming that it is everything he ever wanted and thanking his grandfather again and again. Godbert replies that he has not even begun to begin and raises his hammer once more. Afterward, Gigi turns to Hildibrand, calling him Papa Hildy and proudly declaring himself a Manderville man. Hildibrand opens his arms wide and bids his son come to him so he can have a proper look. The two run toward each other across the snow, only to collide with great force. When the spray of white clears, Hildibrand lies buried in the drift, and Gigi stands nearby once more in his small mammet body, wondering aloud who could have done such a thing to Papa Hildy. Cyr observes that this is exactly like the incident with the vase: something broken, restored in an instant to its original form.</p>
<p>Hildibrand, recovering, decides that on reflection, the mammet body may suit Gigi better after all; it is more manageable. Nashu adds that it is also much more adorable. Gigi then voices the worry that has been weighing on him: how can he ever be accepted as Hildibrand’s son if he remains a mammet? Hildibrand answers that being a Manderville is more than flesh and bone. A Manderville is vigor, compassion, honor—a gentleman for all seasons. Whether one is man or machine makes no difference. If people call him a mammet, he should look them in the eye and proclaim, “I am a Manderville mammet.” He turns to his parents and explains that, though he did not consult them beforehand, he has formally adopted Gigi as his son and ward of House Manderville. Godbert is delighted to hear it, overjoyed at the thought of being addressed as Grandpapa Godbert and of Julyan as Grandmama Julyan. Hildibrand laughs that few things are grander than becoming a grandparent—until Julyan appears and sharply asks what is so grand about any of this. She refuses to be made grandmother to a mammet and declares it is time to beat some sense into her son.</p>
<p>After witnessing all this, Cyr is left shaken. He mutters that he has heard tales of dark knights before, but whatever he has just seen might be worse—and perhaps even heretical. Even so, he has no intention of risking his life to find out. To him, the whole Manderville family appears utterly mad. At least, he grudgingly admits, the mammet seems to have overcome its existential crisis; before today, he did not know such a thing was even possible for a mammet. Then he catches himself. It is a mammet. Why should he care what it thinks or feels? He reminds himself to follow procedure, report to his superiors, and take one step at a time. Back in Foundation, he does so, explaining that Gigi has been adopted by House Manderville with House Fortemps as witness. His superiors respond by taking him to task for his “gross mishandling of the situation.” They are convinced the mammet is a product of heretical machinations and order him to redouble his efforts to prove it. That will not be easy. Gigi has abandoned his quest to recover his memories and thrown himself wholly into his new life as a Manderville mammet, searching for hints of a case at Hildibrand’s side. Cyr himself is not certain of the Tribunal’s theory, but he cannot deny that there is something exceedingly unusual about the mammet. You saw it too: in both the vase and his own body, he wielded reconstructive magicks that restored things perfectly to their original form. Such magicks are not rare, but Gigi’s power is unlike any Cyr has ever seen before.</p>

<p>シルは、まず確認せずにはいられなかった。ギギが「マメット」であることについては、さすがに同意してくれるのだろう、と。まさか本気で別の何かだとは思っていないはずだ、と念を押すように言う。あなたが返事をするより早く、ナシュ・マカラッカが慌てて口を挟み、ギギが「Papa Hildy」に向けたあの言葉は本心ではなく、きっと自分のことを「Mama」だと思っているに違いないと半ば本気で言い出す。ヒルディブランドは、これをただの子どもらしい反抗期と受け止めていた。父の道は決して平坦ではないが、自分はギギの守護者にして、誰よりも息子を大切に思うマンダヴィルの男である。この試練を乗り越え、必ずや息子と和解してみせると胸を張る。ナシュは、盗賊を暴き、決闘の達人を打ち倒し、アンデッドの軍勢すら率いた男なら、家族の揉め事くらい訳はないと元気よく同意する。シルはそこで話を打ち切った。呼び方がどうであれ、ギギが出所不明のマメットであり、そのマメットが姿を消したという事実は変わらない。もしイシュガルドを出てしまっているのなら、行き先を急いで突き止めねばならない。彼は手際よく捜索の段取りを示す。自分は「アーク・オブ・ザ・ワーシー」の門番に話を聞き、ヒルディブランドとナシュは飛空艇発着所を調べ、あなたは工房近くの城門の衛兵に聞き込みを行う。そして、全員が門前に再集合し、結果を持ち寄るのだ。</p>
<p>ファウンデーションの門で、あなたが問いかけると、衛兵はつば広帽子をかぶった小さな影のことを思い出す。そいつがここを通り、物資を運ぶ船の乗船券を買って、ファルコンネスト行きの補給船に乗り込んだというのだ。別の兵士はララフェル族の噂を口走りかけ、自分でもそれが偏見だと気づいて慌てて言い直す。やがてあなたが集合場所に戻ると、シルは「正門から出ていった中に、ギギと思しき者はいなかった」と報告し、ヒルディブランドも飛空艇発着所で該当する人物は見つからなかったと告げる。あなたの報告を合わせると、確かな手がかりはファルコンネスト行きの補給船だけだった。シルは、あの凍てついた前哨地に戻らねばならないかと嘆くが、ヒルディブランドは一歩も引かない。ギギがどこへ行こうとも必ず追いつき、息子として抱きしめるのだと宣言する。シルは、ジュエル・クロージャーでギギが花瓶を修復した一件と、その後の反応を思い返し、別の可能性を口にする。もしかするとギギは、自分が何者であり、何のために作られたかを思い出してしまったのではないか。異端の温床と呼ばれるクルザス西部高地に戻り、イシュガルドで得た情報を主たる異端者に報告しようとしているのではないか、と。彼には、今回の失踪がどうにも異端の匂いを放っているように思えた。一方ヒルディブランドは、ギギは悩みを忘れて雪で遊ぶために戻ったのだと主張する。ナシュは二人の言い分を聞きつつも、一行と共にクルザスへ向かった。</p>
<p>クルザス西部高地のリバーズミートに差しかかると、ヒルディブランドが突然立ち止まり、雪の上に残る小さな足跡を指さす。彼は、その足跡がギギのものだと断言する。ナシュは身をかがめて見入り、「クロックワーク・ミニオンが歩いたみたいに可愛い足跡だ」と目を輝かせる。足跡は川沿いを北へと続いていた。シルは、マメットが前哨地を離れ、そのまま荒野へ向かった証拠だと受け止め、やはり異端者のもとへ向かっているのだろうと考える。ナシュは、「もしうちの子がそういう連中に会っても、『いりません』と言って帰ってくるはずだ」と言い返す。そのとき、彼女はふと、自分が以前「グランパパ・ゴッドベルトも、あの修復の技を見たがるはずだ」とギギに話したことを思い出す。もしかすると、ギギはそれを実際に見せるためにここへ来たのではないか、と推測するのだ。ヒルディブランドはその考えにすぐ飛びつき、息子が祖父母に会いたいと思うのは当然だと喜ぶ。シルは「つい先ほど『父じゃない』と言ったばかりだ」とぼやきつつも、今さら言い争っても仕方ないと考える。足跡はなおも北へ続いており、一行はその先へと歩みを進めた。</p>
<p>やがて雪の上に、動かない小さな影が見つかる。それは仰向けに倒れたギギのマメットの身体だった。帽子には小さな何かが勢いよくぶつかったような跡がつき、砕けた氷が貼り付いている。近くには、同じように雪玉を受けて倒れたシュタインボックの死骸が転がっていた。ギギは頭を押さえながらうめき声を上げ、目を開けてあなたたちの姿を認める。ここまで追いかけてきたのだと悟ったように、かすれた声で話し出す。ヒルディブランドは、この光景を「少し行き過ぎた雪合戦の結果」と受け取り、「祖父母と雪遊びがしたかったのなら、最初からそう言ってくれればよかったのに。Papa Hildy はずっと心配していた」と語りかける。シルは倒れた獣とギギを見比べ、本当に損傷していないのかと問いかけるが、ヒルディブランドは問題ないと言い切る。自分など頭から地面に叩きつけられたことが何度もあるが、今もこうして元気に動いていると胸を張るのだ。シルが皮肉を返そうとしたとき、皆の視線が自分の背後に向けられているのに気づき、振り返る。そこにはゴッドベルトが立っていた。彼は、文明から遠く離れた雪原で知った顔ぶれに会えた幸運を語り、先ほどまでジュリアンとの決闘に夢中で、近くにいたことに気づかなかったと詫びる。そして、「もしよければ一緒にどうかね」と穏やかに誘いかける。ギギは「グランパパ・ゴッドベルト」と呼びかけ、ナシュから聞いた「生と死をも操る槌」の話を持ち出し、自分に真の命を与え、本物の少年にしてほしいと必死に願い出る。</p>
<p>ゴッドベルトは、これは本当に望むことなのかと念を押し、「かなり痛むかもしれない」と正直に告げる。ギギは、「人間になれるならどんな痛みでも耐えてみせる」と答える。ゴッドベルトはハンマーを掲げ、ビエルゴの導きを乞う言葉を口にしながら振り下ろす。作業が終わると、ギギは新たな肉体で立ち上がり、その身体がまさに自分の望んだすべてだと喜びをあらわにし、祖父に何度も礼を言う。ゴッドベルトは「まだ本当の始まりですらない」と言って再び槌を振るう。その後、ギギはヒルディブランドの方へ向き直り、「Papa Hildy」と呼びながら、自分はマンダヴィル家の男になれたと誇らしげに告げる。ヒルディブランドは両腕を広げ、「こっちへおいで、よく顔を見せてくれ」と息子を呼ぶ。ふたりは雪原を駆け寄るが、その勢いのまま激しくぶつかり合う。雪が舞い上がり、視界が晴れたとき、雪の中に倒れているのはヒルディブランドであり、その傍らには元の小さなマメットの姿に戻ったギギが立っていた。ギギは、「Papa Hildy にこんなことをしたのは誰だろう」と不安げに呟き、状況を飲み込もうとしている。シルは、その様子を見て、ジュエル・クロージャーで粉々になった花瓶が、一瞬で元通りになった出来事を思い出す。今回もまた、壊れたものが一瞬で「元の姿」に戻ったのだ。</p>
<p>ヒルディブランドは体を起こしながら考え込み、結果としてこのマメットの姿のほうがギギには合っているのではないかと結論づける。扱いやすくもあり、ナシュに言わせれば何よりも可愛らしい姿だという。そこでギギは、ずっと胸の内に溜め込んでいた不安を打ち明ける。マメットのままでいる自分が、果たして本当にヒルディブランドの息子として受け入れられるのか、という悩みだった。ヒルディブランドは、その言葉を聞いてようやく彼の苦しみの正体を理解する。マンダヴィルであることを決めるのは、肉体が肉か金属かという違いではない。活力と、慈しみと、誇り高さ──どんな季節でも紳士たらんとする心構えこそが、マンダヴィルを形づくるのだ。人間か機械かは問題ではない。他人がギギをマメットと呼ぶのなら、その目を見て「自分はマンダヴィル・マメットだ」と言えばいい、と彼は語る。続けて、ヒルディブランドは自分の両親に向き直り、事前に相談しなかったことを詫びつつ、すでにギギをマンダヴィル家の養子兼被後見人として正式に迎え入れたことを告げる。ゴッドベルトは大いに喜び、「グランパパ・ゴッドベルト」そして「グランママ・ジュリアン」と呼ばれる日を待ち望んでいたのだと感慨深げに語る。ヒルディブランドは、「祖父母になるというのは何よりも素晴らしいことだ」と笑うが、その直後にジュリアンが現れ、「一体どこがそんなに素晴らしいのか」と冷たく言い放つ。彼女は「マメットの祖母になるつもりはない」ときっぱり断言し、息子に現実を叩き込む時が来たとばかりにハンマーを構えるのだった。</p>
<p>一連の出来事を目の当たりにしたシルは、大きく動揺していた。彼はかつて暗黒騎士の噂話を耳にしたことがあるが、今見たものはそれに勝るとも劣らない不可解さを帯びている。しかし、それが何であれ、自分の命を賭けて確かめるつもりはなかった。彼の目には、マンダヴィル家の面々は揃って常識外れに映る。それでも、少なくともギギの「存在意義を巡る悩み」が収まったように見えることについては、認めざるを得ない。今日この日まで、マメットにまで「存在の危機」というものがあるとは思ってもみなかったと、彼は苦笑混じりに漏らす。その直後に我に返り、相手はあくまでマメットであり、その考えや感情を気に病む必要はないのだと自分に言い聞かせる。手順に従って上官へ報告し、一歩一歩進めていけばよいのだと、心の中で繰り返す。ファウンデーションへ戻った彼は、フォルタン家の立ち会いのもとギギがマンダヴィル家の養子として認められた経緯を含め、一連の報告を行う。しかし返ってきたのは称賛ではなく、「重大な不手際」としての叱責だった。上官たちは、ギギを異端的な技術によって作られた存在だと信じて疑わず、「それが動かぬ事実であると証明せよ」と命じ、むしろ調査を強化するよう求めてくる。</p>
<p>だが現実には、その命令を遂行するのは容易ではなかった。今のギギは、失われた記憶を取り戻そうとすることをやめ、「マンダヴィル・マメット」としての新しい日々に身を投じている。ヒルディブランドの傍らで、「事件」の匂いがするものがないかと目を光らせているのだ。シル自身は、上官ほど確信をもって異端の産物だと言い切ることはできない。それでもあのマメットが、常軌を逸した力を持っていることだけは認めざるを得なかった。あなたも見たように、ギギは粉々になった花瓶を元通りにし、自らの身体ですら、あるべき「元の姿」に戻してみせた。物を修復する魔法自体は珍しくないが、ギギの再構成の力は、シルが今まで目にしてきたどの魔法とも異なっていた。</p>

<p>Cyr 一開始就忍不住先確認：你應該同意 Gigi 是 mammet，對吧？總不會真的相信他是別的什麼東西吧？你還來不及回答，Nashu Mhakaracca 就急著插話，堅持說 Gigi 剛才對 Papa Hildy 講的那些話一定不是出於真心，真正的意思大概是把她當成「Mama」。Hildibrand 則完全是另一種反應，他把這當成普通的「孩子叛逆期」。他說，當父親的路本來就不會平坦，但他身為 Gigi 的守護者，也是自豪的 Manderville 父親，一定會跨過這道試煉，再次和心愛的兒子和好。Nashu 非常贊同，覺得一個能揭穿小偷、打倒決鬥強者、還曾率領 undead 軍隊的人，要解決一點家庭問題根本不算什麼。Cyr 在這裡出手把話題拉回來。無論大家怎麼稱呼，Gigi 始終是來路不明的 mammet，而現在這個 mammet 不見了。如果他已經離開 Ishgard，就必須儘快查清楚他的去向。Cyr 很快排出行動計畫：自己去 Arc of the Worthy 問門衛，Hildibrand 和 Nashu 去飛空艇發著場，你則到工房附近的城門找守衛打聽。等大家都問完，再回到城門前集合交換情報。</p>
<p>在 Foundation 的城門，你詢問當值的守衛，他回想起不久前確實有個戴寬邊帽的小個子來過，買了船票，搭上前往 Falcon’s Nest 的補給船。另一名士兵則差點脫口而出一些關於 Lalafell 的壞話，意識到不妥後慌忙改口。回到集合地點時，Cyr 報告說：從正門出去的旅人裡沒有人符合 Gigi 的特徵；Hildibrand 也表示飛空艇發著場那邊完全沒有看到類似的乘客。加上你的情報之後，唯一確定的線索就剩下那艘前往 Falcon’s Nest 的補給船。Cyr 一想到要回那個寒冷陰鬱的前哨就忍不住抱怨，但 Hildibrand 完全不退縮，說無論 Gigi 走到哪裡，他都會追上去，把他找回來，再一次以父親的身分抱住他。Cyr 想起在 The Jeweled Crozier 時，Gigi 修復花瓶那件事，以及那之後的反應，提出另一種可能：也許 Gigi 已經記起自己是什麼、為何被製造，選擇回到向來被視為異端溫床的 Coerthas Western Highlands，把在 Ishgard 收集到的情報交給那些「主子」。在他眼裡，這整件事都瀰漫著濃濃的 heresy 氣味。Hildibrand 則仍堅持，Gigi 只是想在雪地裡玩耍，把煩惱一併丟進風裡。Nashu 聽著兩人的說法，但還是跟著大家一同動身前往 Coerthas。</p>
<p>來到 Coerthas Western Highlands 的 Riversmeet 一帶時，Hildibrand 忽然停下腳步，指著雪地上的一串小小足跡。他說自己一看就知道，那是 Gigi 的腳印。Nashu 靠近一看，覺得連足跡都可愛，彷彿是某個 clockwork minion 踩過去一樣。這串足跡沿著河岸一路往北延伸。Cyr 把這當成證據：mammet 離開前哨之後，直接往荒野深處走，大概是去和 heretic 會合。Nashu 不滿地反駁，如果他們家的「小女孩」真的遇到那種人，一定會直接說自己不需要，然後轉身離開。就在這時，她想起自己曾經對 Gigi 提過，Grandpapa Godbert 也許會想親眼看看他的「那個本事」，於是猜測 Gigi 很可能是為了找祖父才來到這裡。Hildibrand 非常樂於接受這個解釋，覺得孩子想見祖父母再自然不過。Cyr 雖然提醒他，Gigi 剛剛才喊過「你不是我的父親」，但也知道此刻爭辯沒有意義。足跡一路延續，一行人便沿著這條線索繼續往北走去。</p>
<p>沒多久，你們就在厚厚的積雪中找到一個倒臥的身影──那正是 Gigi 的 mammet 身體。他仰躺在地，帽子上沾著碎冰，就像被什麼小而快速的東西狠狠砸中；附近幾頭 steinbock 的屍體也帶著相似的雪球痕跡。Gigi 抱著頭發出呻吟，慢慢睜開眼睛，看見你們追來的樣子，虛弱地開口說話。Hildibrand 把眼前的景象理解成一場有點失控的雪球戰後果，還說如果 Gigi 是想和祖父母一起打雪仗，早點說就好了，Papa Hildy 一直很擔心。Cyr 看了看那些倒地的野獸，又看向 Gigi，問他是否真的沒有損傷；Hildibrand 卻說這種程度算不了什麼，自己過去頭朝下插進地面的次數多到數不清，現在不也好端端地站在這裡嗎。Cyr 正想回一句，卻注意到大家的視線都越過自己看向後方，回頭一看，只見 Godbert 就站在那裡。他愉快地向眾人致意，說能在遠離文明的地方遇到熟人真是幸運，又為自己剛才忙著和 Julyan 決鬥，遲遲沒有注意到你們而道歉，甚至順口邀請大家要不要一起加入。Gigi 此時只喊著「Grandpapa Godbert」，搬出 Nashu 曾說過的那句話──祖父的 hammer 據說擁有生與死的力量，於是懇求他賜予自己真正的生命，讓自己變成一個 real boy。</p>
<p>Godbert 先確認他是否真的下定決心，並老實說過程可能會很痛。Gigi 說，為了成為真正的男孩，無論再怎麼痛都可以忍受。於是 Godbert 舉起 hammer，請求 Byregot 指引，開始在這片雪地上動手敲擊。當一切結束時，Gigi 已經以全新的肉身站在那裡，驚喜地看著自己的雙手雙腳，說這具身體正是自己一直渴望的一切，一再向 Grandpapa 道謝。Godbert 則回答自己連真正的開始都稱不上，接著又再度揮起鐵槌。之後，Gigi 轉身面向 Hildibrand，叫了聲 Papa Hildy，自豪地宣告自己成為了一名 Manderville man。Hildibrand 張開雙臂，讓他走近，好好看清兒子的模樣。父子二人迎面跑向彼此，然而在雪地中央重重撞成一團。等到漫天雪花落下，倒在雪堆裡的人是 Hildibrand，而站在他身旁的，則是又變回原本小小 mammet 姿態的 Gigi。他一邊喊著 Papa Hildy，一邊困惑地說不清剛剛到底發生了什麼，就像不知道是誰對 Papa 做了那件事。Cyr 看著這個場面，立刻聯想到在 The Jeweled Crozier 看到的花瓶事件──全然破碎的東西，竟然在一瞬間回到原來的模樣。</p>
<p>Hildibrand 撐起身體，思考了一下，最后反而覺得這樣的 mammet 姿態可能比較適合 Gigi，至少在各方面都更容易照顧。Nashu 也馬上說，這樣看起來更可愛。這時，Gigi 終於說出心裡一直在擔心的事：如果自己仍然只是一個 mammet，真的有辦法被當作 Hildibrand 的兒子接受嗎？原來這個問題一直困住他。Hildibrand 聽完，總算理解他的煩惱究竟是什麼。他說，Manderville 是不會被「肉身還是金屬」這種東西決定的。所謂 Manderville，是活力、是體貼、是榮耀，是不論任何季節、任何處境都努力維持紳士風度的生活方式。至於是人還是機械，其實沒那麼重要。如果別人叫他 mammet，他就應該直視對方的眼睛，堂堂正正地說：「不，我是 Manderville mammet。」說完這些，他轉向自己的父母，先為沒有事先討論就做決定道歉，接著宣布自己已經正式在 House Manderville 名義下收養 Gigi，讓他成為兒子與家族的被保護人。Godbert 聽了非常高興，說早就期待有一天能聽到「Grandpapa Godbert」和「Grandmama Julyan」這樣的稱呼。Hildibrand 也笑說，原來成為祖父母真的是人生難得的喜悅。就在這時，Julyan 出現，冷冷問了一句「到底哪裡 grand」，明確表示自己可不想當什麼 mammet 的奶奶，並認為是時候好好「修理」一下這個兒子，讓他認清現實。</p>
<p>看完整件事的 Cyr 顯然受到不小衝擊。他自言自語，說以前聽過關於 dark knight 的各種傳聞，沒想到今天看到的情景可能更勝一籌，或許還帶著幾分 heretical 的氣息。不過，就算真是那樣，他也沒打算拿性命去確認。對他來說，整個 Manderville 家族都像是一群完全不按常理出牌的人。即便如此，他還是承認，至少這個 mammet 看起來已經度過了自己的「existential crisis」，在此之前，他從沒想過 mammet 也會有這種東西。下一個瞬間，他又驚覺自己居然會這樣形容一個造物，連忙在心裡拉回理性：那畢竟只是 mammet，沒必要太在意它的想法或感受。他提醒自己要遵循程序、照規矩向上級報告，一步一步來就好。回到 Foundation 之後，他如實說明整個過程，包括 Gigi 在 House Fortemps 見證下被 House Manderville 正式收養的事。上級給他的回應卻是一頓嚴厲的責備，指責他「嚴重處理不當」。在他們心中，這個 mammet 無疑是 heretical 技術的產物，於是命令 Cyr 必須加倍努力，拿出能證明這一點的確鑿證據。</p>
<p>然而現實非常棘手。Gigi 現在已經完全放棄追尋「失去的記憶」，全心投入身為「Manderville mammet」的新生活，每天跟在 Hildibrand 身邊，一起尋找任何可能變成「案件」的線索。Cyr 自己並沒有像上級那樣篤定認定他是異端之作，但也不得不承認，這個 mammet 的確異常。你也親眼看到：他能讓被打碎的花瓶完好如初，也能讓自己剛被改造過的身體瞬間回復原狀。修復類魔法本身並不罕見，但 Gigi 展現的這種 reconstructive magicks，和 Cyr 過去見過的任何術式都不一樣。對他而言，關於這個自稱 Manderville mammet 的小小身影，還有太多無法解釋的地方。Gigi 的故事，顯然還沒有結束。</p>
