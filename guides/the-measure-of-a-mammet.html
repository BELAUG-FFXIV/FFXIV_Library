<p>Cyr, still clinging to what little sanity he feels he has left, first makes one point painfully clear: you at least agree that Gigi is a mammet, right? You don’t honestly believe he is anything else? Before you can answer, Nashu hastily defends the child, insisting he surely didn’t mean those harsh words about “Papa Hildy.” The only reasonable interpretation, she gasps, is that he must think she is his mama. Hildibrand, undeterred by rejection, straightens with dramatic resolve. The road of fatherhood is never smooth, he declares, but as guardian of Gigi and doting parent extraordinaire, he will find a way to overcome this trial and be reconciled with his beloved son. Nashu is quick to cheer him on, declaring that a man who has unmasked thieves, defeated duelists, and even led an army of the undead should have no trouble solving a simple case of childhood rebellion.</p>
<p>Cyr, trying to stay on task, decides to ignore the part about undead. What matters now is finding the mammet. If Gigi has left Ishgard, they must learn of it as soon as possible. He proposes a plan: he will question the sentries at the Arc of the Worthy, while Hildibrand and Nashu investigate the airship landing. You, meanwhile, are to speak with the guard at the gate near the manufactory. When each has gathered what they can, you will regroup and share your findings.</p>
<p>At Foundation’s gate, Herewart recalls seeing a “little fella with a wide-brimmed hat.” The boy bought passage on a supply ship bound for Falcon’s Nest. Another guard stumbles through a clumsy attempt at small talk about Lalafell, nearly digging himself into a hole with stereotypes before awkwardly backpedaling. When you regroup, Cyr reports that no one resembling Gigi passed through the main gates, and Hildibrand confirms that the sentries at the airship landing also saw no such traveler. The only solid lead is the supply ship to Falcon’s Nest. Cyril groans at the thought of returning to that freezing pit of despair, but Hildibrand is unshaken: wherever Gigi goes, he will follow, find him, and embrace him as his son once more.</p>
<p>In his mind, however, Gigi’s destination is not merely an outpost. There is, he proclaims, but one reason the boy would return to those frozen wastes—to frolic in the snow and cast his worries to the wind. Cyr is unconvinced. He remembers Gigi using mysterious arcane power to mend a priceless vase, only to fall into morose turmoil once he accepted that he was a mammet. To Cyr, it seems more likely that Gigi remembered what he is, and what he was made for. Western Coerthas is notorious as a hotbed of heresy, and it was there that they first discovered him. What if he has returned to his heretic masters to deliver the intelligence he gathered in Ishgard? Cyr sniffs the air and triumphantly declares that he finally senses the unmistakable scent of heresy. Without waiting for argument, he urges everyone onward: they have a heretic—and a mammet—to catch. Nashu mutters that she is beginning to suspect Inquisitor Cyr does not think particularly highly of their “little girl.”</p>
<p>Hildibrand refuses to assume the worst. Until Cyr clearly states his feelings, he insists, it would be improper to presume. Instead, they should gently steer him toward a more favorable impression of Gigi—a boy of pure heart and good intent. Subtle persuasion in all things, he declares, is the Manderville way.</p>
<p>In the snows of Coerthas Western Highlands, at Riversmeet, Hildibrand suddenly halts. He recognizes a trail of tiny footprints and proclaims without hesitation that Gigi passed this way. Nashu coos over how cute the tracks look, comparing them to prints left by a clockwork minion. The trail leads north along the river. Cyr seizes upon it as proof of his theory: the mammet left Falcon’s Nest and immediately headed out into heretic territory. He can barely contain his eagerness at the thought of catching Gigi in the company of traitors. Nashu bristles at his tone, insisting that if their baby girl ever encountered heretics, she would look them straight in the eye and firmly refuse. Then, in a rare moment of insight, she recalls telling Gigi that Grandpapa Godbert might like to witness his restorative “trick.” Perhaps the child came out here to find him. Hildibrand is delighted by this deduction, declaring that Gigi must be eager to meet his grandparents—never mind that he recently denied them as parents. To him, this only proves that Gigi is a noble young gentleman keen to explore his lineage. Cyr, exhausted, mutters that he really cannot be bothered to argue. The tracks continue north.</p>
<p>They finally find Gigi lying motionless in the snow, his cap crusted with ice as if struck by something small and fast—a snowball. When he stirs, clutching his head, he recognizes you and realizes you followed him. Hildibrand, convinced this was simply an overzealous snowball fight, chides him gently for not inviting his grandparents, explaining how worried “Papa Hildy” has been. Cyr, however, notes more grimly that the nearby steinbocks lie dead, also struck by snowballs, and wonders aloud whether Gigi is truly unharmed. Hildibrand declares that a simple blow to the head could never bring down a Manderville; he has himself been slammed headfirst into the ground more times than he can remember, even from malms above, and remains—as he puts it—brilliant. Cyr drily observes that the earth may not share that opinion, only to realize that everyone is suddenly looking past him. Godbert has arrived.</p>
<p>The patriarch cheerfully greets them, apologizing for not noticing sooner; he and Julyan have been engrossed in a duel. He politely invites everyone to join. Gigi immediately recognizes him as “Grandpapa Godbert” and rushes toward him, voice trembling with hope. Recalling Nashu’s description, he pleads for the power of life and death. He begs Godbert to grant him life—true life—and make him a real boy. Godbert asks if he is absolutely certain; the process may sting. Gigi does not hesitate. He will endure whatever he must in order to become human. Godbert raises his hammer and begins.</p>
<p>When the work is done, Gigi stares at his transformed body in awe. It is everything he ever wanted: perfect, human, real. He showers his grandfather with gratitude—only for Godbert to calmly inform him that he has scarcely begun. Calling on Byregot to guide his hammer, he continues his “craft,” and in a sudden surge of emotion, Gigi turns to Hildibrand, declaring that he is a Manderville man. Hildibrand, eyes shining, calls his son into his arms. The two rush to embrace—only for there to be a spectacular impact, and when the dust settles, Hildibrand lies crumpled in the snow while Gigi, once more in his small mammet body, stands over him in dismay. Something went terribly awry with the “real boy” form.</p>
<p>Cyr is stunned; it is just like the vase all over again. In an instant, Gigi has restored himself to his original shape. Hildibrand, after a moment’s reflection, concludes that this body may in fact be the best fit—more manageable, as he delicately puts it. Nashu adds that it is also much more adorable. Still troubled, Gigi asks how he can possibly be accepted as Hildibrand’s son if he remains a mammet. Hildibrand finally understands: this fear has been gnawing at him all along. He reassures Gigi that Manderville-ness is not a matter of flesh and bone. It is vigor, compassion, honor—a gentleman for all seasons. Whether man or machine, it makes no difference. If others call him a mammet, he should look them in the eye and declare: “Nay—I am a Manderville mammet!”</p>
<p>Hildibrand then formally informs his parents that he has adopted Gigi as his son and ward of House Manderville, apologizing for not consulting them sooner. Circumstances forced his hand. Godbert is overjoyed; he always knew his son was fond of the mammet, but to hear him speak openly of adoption is another matter entirely. He revels in the words “Grandpapa Godbert” and “Grandmama Julyan,” claiming he has waited years to hear them. Hildibrand laughs that few things in life are grander than becoming a grandparent. Julyan promptly appears to challenge that sentiment. She flatly refuses to be made grandmother to a “buggering mammet” and declares it is past time she beat some sense into her beloved boy.</p>
<p>Watching from the sidelines, Cyr feels his already tenuous grasp on normalcy slipping. He recalls dark rumors of knights of shadow, but decides that whatever he just witnessed might be even worse—and likely heretical besides. Still, rules be damned, he has no intention of investigating that. The whole family is utterly mad, he concludes, and he will never understand how their house rose to such prominence. Yet, at the very least, the mammet seems to have overcome its existential crisis—something he had never imagined a mammet could even have in the first place. Catching himself, he snaps back to reality. It is a mammet. Why should he care what it claims to think or feel? The Mandervilles’ idiocy is contagious, and he must not succumb. Procedure, he tells himself. Report to his superiors. One step at a time.</p>
<p>Back in Foundation, Cyr relates the aftermath. Once informed of Gigi’s formal adoption by House Manderville—witnessed and validated by House Fortemps—his superiors did not praise his caution. Instead, they reprimanded him for his “gross mishandling” of the situation. They remain convinced that the mammet is born of heretical machinations and have ordered Cyr to redouble his efforts to prove this “incontrovertible” fact. This may prove difficult. Gigi has abandoned his quest to reclaim his lost memories and has thrown himself wholeheartedly into his new role as a Manderville mammet, constantly searching for clues and “cases” at his doting father’s side.</p>
<p>Though Cyr does not share the Tribunal’s conviction, he cannot deny that there is something exceedingly unusual about Gigi. You witnessed it yourself: the effortless restoration of a shattered vase and the reconstruction of his own body. Reconstructive magicks are not rare, but the way Gigi’s power manifests is unlike anything Cyr has seen. Whatever Gigi is—or was made to be—his story is far from over.</p>

<p>シルは、まず確認せずにはいられなかった。「はっきりさせておきたいのだが……ギギが“マメット”だということには同意してくれるな？　本気で、あれが……」と言いかけたところで、ナシュが慌てて遮る。ギギが「Papa Hildy」に向かって突き付けたきつい言葉は、本心ではないはずだと信じているのだ。そうでなければ──彼は自分のことを「Mama」だと思っているに違いない、とまで考え込んでしまう。</p>
<p>ヒルディブランドは、息子に拒絶された事実よりも、その先に待つ「父親としての試練」に目を輝かせる。父の道は決して平坦ではないが、自分はギギの守護者にして、愛情深き親として、この困難を乗り越え、再び息子と和解してみせる──そう高らかに宣言する。ナシュも勢いよく応じ、盗賊を暴き、剣豪と決闘し、果てはアンデッドの軍勢まで率いた男が、子どもの反抗期ひとつ解決できないはずがないと太鼓判を押す。</p>
<p>シルは、アンデッドうんぬんのくだりを聞かなかったことにしつつ、とにかく今はマメットを見つけることが先決だと話を戻す。もしギギがイシュガルドの外へ出てしまったのなら、一刻も早くその行き先を突き止めねばならない。彼は手際よく捜索計画を立て、自分は「Arc of the Worthy」の門番に話を聞きに行き、ヒルディブランドとナシュは飛空艇着き場を当たるよう指示する。そして、あなたには工房近くの門にいる衛兵への聞き込みを任せることにし、一通り調査を終えたら、ふたたび門前に集まるよう命じた。</p>
<p>ファウンデーションの門で、ヘレワートは「つば広帽子のちっこいの」を見かけたと証言する。供給船の乗船券を買い、ファルコンネスト行きの船に乗り込んだらしい。また別の衛兵は、ララフェルについて余計な噂話を口にしかけ、「今のは全部冗談だ」と慌てて取り繕う。再び合流した一行は、少なくとも正門から出て行った者の中にギギと一致する人物はいなかったこと、飛空艇着き場でもそれらしい姿は目撃されていなかったことを確認する。残る手がかりは、ファルコンネスト行きの船のみ。シルは、凍てつく絶望の地へ舞い戻らねばならない現実に絶望するが、ヒルディブランドは一歩も引かない。「ギギがどこへ行こうとも、自分は追いかけ、見つけ出し、ふたたび息子として抱きしめてみせる」と胸を張る。</p>
<p>そのうえで彼は、ギギが向かった先は単なる前哨地ではないと力説する。コルタス西部高地へ戻った理由はただひとつ──雪の中を駆け回り、悩みを風に飛ばすためだ、と。シルは、そんな気分だったとは到底思えないと反論する。つい先ほどまで、ギギは不思議な力で高価な花瓶を修復し、自分がマメットであるという事実を突きつけられて、ひどく落ち込んでいたではないか。むしろ彼は、自分が何であるか、そして何のために作られたかを思い出したのかもしれない。</p>
<p>コルタス西部高地は異端の温床として知られ、まさに彼らがギギを発見した場所でもある。もしかするとギギは、そこで待つ「異端者の主」のもとへ戻り、イシュガルドで集めた情報を報告しようとしているのではないか──シルはそう推理し、「ついに異端の匂いを嗅ぎ付けた」と鼻を鳴らす。そして、「何をぼさっと突っ立っている！　異端者を捕らえに行くぞ！」と息巻き、先を急いだ。ナシュは、インクィジター・シルがどうにもギギを良く思っていないらしいと不満を漏らすが、ヒルディブランドは、本人が明言しない限り他人の心を決めつけるべきではないと言い、むしろ少しずつ「純粋で善良な少年」という印象を植え付けていこうとナシュに提案する。「何事もさりげなく──それがマンダヴィル流だ」と。</p>
<p>一行はやがて、コルタス西部高地・リバーズミートへと辿り着く。そこでヒルディブランドは、雪の上に残る小さな足跡を見つけ、自信満々に「ギギの足跡だ！」と断言する。ナシュは「足跡まで可愛い」と頬を緩め、それがまるでクロックワーク・ミニオンの足跡のようだと例える。足跡は川沿いを北へと続いていた。シルはこれを好機と捉え、マメットが前哨地を離れ、北へ向かった証拠だと喜ぶ。異端者との接触が近いと信じて疑わないのだ。</p>
<p>ところがナシュは、そんな彼の物言いに反発する。「もしうちの子が異端者と出くわしたら、ちゃんと断って帰ってくるに決まってる」ときっぱり言い返し、ふと先ほどの会話を思い出す。自分はたしか、ギギに「グランパパ・ゴッドベルトも、あの修復の技を見たがるかもしれない」と話した。もしかすると、本当にそれを確かめるために、ギギはここまで来たのではないか。ヒルディブランドはこの推理を絶賛し、「祖父母に会いたくてたまらないのだろう」と頷く。シルは、「さっき『父じゃない』と言い切ったばかりじゃないか」と冷静なツッコミを入れるが、ヒルディブランドは「家系に興味を持つ立派な若者」と都合よく解釈し、三世代揃っての感動的な再会を夢見て歩みを速める。</p>
<p>やがて一行は、雪の上に倒れ伏すマメットを発見する。帽子には小さく丸い何かが勢いよくぶつかったような跡があり、凍りついた雪片が貼り付いていた。ギギは頭を押さえながら目を覚まし、あなたが自分を追って来たと知る。ヒルディブランドは、「雪合戦なら一言いってくれれば、祖父母も喜んで参加したのに」と笑いつつ、心配していたことを打ち明ける。</p>
<p>シルは周囲を見渡し、雪玉に打たれて倒れたらしいシュタインボックの亡骸を見て、「本当に壊れてはいないのか」と訝しむ。しかしヒルディブランドは、「マンダヴィルが、頭をひとつぶつけたぐらいで倒れるものか」と意に介さない。自分など、これまでに二十回以上、時にはかなりの高度から頭から地面に叩きつけられてきたが、その知性はいささかも曇っていない、と誇らしげに語る。シルは「地面のほうはたまったものではなかっただろう」と皮肉を返そうとして──彼の後ろに立つ人物の存在に気付き、言葉を飲み込んだ。</p>
<p>そこにいたのは、ゴッドベルト・マンダヴィルその人だった。文明から遠く離れた雪原で旧知の顔ぶれに出会えたことを幸運と言い、先ほどまでジュリアンとの決闘に夢中になっていたと詫びる。そして、よければ自分たちの勝負に加わらないかと誘いかける。ギギはすぐさま「Grandpapa Godbert！」と叫び、祖父のもとへ駆け寄ると、ナシュから聞いた「生と死を操る力」のことを持ち出し、必死に懇願する。「どうか自分に命を与え、本物の“少年”にしてほしい」と。</p>
<p>ゴッドベルトは「本当にそれでいいのか」と念を押す。多少痛みを伴うかもしれない。しかし、ギギは迷わない。人間になるためなら、どんな苦痛も耐え抜いてみせると断言する。ゴッドベルトはハンマーを掲げ、「ビエルゴよ、我が槌を導きたまえ」と祈りつつ、作業を始めた。ほどなくして、ギギは新たな身体を見下ろし、その完璧さに感嘆する。望んでいたものがすべて手に入った、これこそ自分の求めた肉体だと叫び、祖父へ感謝を捧げる。</p>
<p>しかし、ゴッドベルトは「まだ始まったばかりだ」と言い、さらに槌を振るう。やがてギギは「Papa Hildy！　自分はマンダヴィル家の男だ！」と興奮気味に叫び、ヒルディブランドは「息子よ、こっちへおいで！」と両腕を広げる。二人は雪原の中で互いに駆け寄り──そして、盛大にぶつかり合った。次の瞬間、雪の中に倒れているのはヒルディブランドであり、その傍らには、元のマメットの姿へと戻ったギギが立ち尽くしていた。</p>
<p>シルは、先ほどの花瓶の一件を思い出し、「まるであのときと同じだ」と呟く。ギギは、またしても瞬く間に「元通り」の姿へ戻ってみせたのだ。ヒルディブランドは少し考えた末、この身体のほうが「扱いやすい」とやんわり表現し、ギギの姿を受け入れる。ナシュも、「そのほうが断然可愛い」と太鼓判を押す。</p>
<p>それでもギギは、不安を拭い去ることができない。マメットのままでは、父の息子として受け入れてもらえないのではないか──ずっとその思いに苛まれてきたのだと打ち明ける。ヒルディブランドはようやく、ギギの苦悩の正体を理解する。マンダヴィルであるかどうかは、肉体の材質では決まらない。大切なのは活力であり、慈愛であり、名誉だ。四季を通じて紳士であることこそがマンダヴィルの本質であり、人間か機械かは些末な問題にすぎない。他人がマメットと呼ぶのなら、堂々と見返してこう言えばいい──「否、自分はマンダヴィル・マメットだ」と。</p>
<p>続けてヒルディブランドは、これまで事情を知らせぬままにしていたことを詫びつつ、改めて両親に告げる。すでにギギを息子として正式に養子に迎え、マンダヴィル家の被後見人としたのだと。ゴッドベルトは大喜びし、「たしかにマメットを気に入っていたようだが、まさか本当に息子として迎えるとは」と目を丸くする。それでも「Grandpapa Godbert」「Grandmama Julyan」と呼ばれる日を、どれほど待ち望んでいたことかと喜びを爆発させる。ヒルディブランドも、「孫を持つ喜びは人生の大きな賜物だ」と笑い、三世代揃って笑い合う。</p>
<p>そこへジュリアンが現れ、その浮かれた空気に冷や水を浴びせる。「何が“grand”だって？」と不機嫌そうに言い放ち、「マメットのばあさんになんて、絶対にならないからね」ときっぱり拒絶する。そして、可愛い息子にもう少しマトモな考えを叩き込む時が来たようだと、不穏な笑みを浮かべるのだった。</p>
<p>一連の騒動を見守っていたシルは、もはや自分の常識が揺らいでいるのを自覚する。彼はかつて、「闇の騎士」についての噂話を耳にしたこともあったが、今目の前で繰り広げられた出来事は、それすら上回る何かではないかと疑う。しかし、いかに異端めいていようと、自ら命を賭して確かめるなど論外だ。マンダヴィル家の面々は、まとめて「正気とは言い難い」と結論付ける一方で、少なくともギギの抱えていた存在の危機は、どうにか乗り越えられたようだと安堵する。まさか、マメットにまで「存在意義の悩み」があるとは思いもしなかったが──そう言いかけて、ハッと我に返る。</p>
<p>「いや、何を言っている。あれはマメットだ。思考や感情について案じる必要など、どこにある」と自分を諫め、マンダヴィル家の「馬鹿さ加減」が伝染してしまわないよう、必死に意識を引き締める。手順を守り、上官へ報告する。一歩ずつ、やるべきことをやる──それだけを心の支えに、シルは深く息を吐いた。</p>
<p>イシュガルドへ戻った彼は、ギギの養子縁組がフォルタン家立ち会いのもと正式に認められたことを報告したが、待っていたのは称賛ではなく叱責だった。上官たちは、マメットを異端的な企ての産物だと信じて疑わず、「事態の重大さを理解していない」とシルの対応を厳しく糾弾する。そして、ギギが異端に関わる存在であることを「動かぬ事実」として証明するよう、むしろ調査を強化するよう命じるのだった。</p>
<p>しかし現状、ギギは記憶を取り戻す旅をやめ、「マンダヴィル・マメット」としての新たな人生にすべてを注いでいる。父ヒルディブランドの傍らで、何か事件の匂いがしないかと目を輝かせているのだ。シル自身は上官ほど異端を確信しているわけではない。だが、あのマメットが「並外れている」ことだけは否定しようがなかった。</p>
<p>粉々になった花瓶を、一瞬で元通りにしてみせたあの力──そして、自らの身体すら同じように再構築してしまうあの魔法。物を修復する術自体は珍しくないものの、ギギのそれは、シルがこれまで見てきたどんな魔法とも異なっている。あのマメットが何者であり、何のために作られたのか。その答えは、まだどこか雪の彼方に隠れているのだろう。</p>

<p>一開始，Cyr 還是忍不住想先釐清一件事──「我們先說好，你也同意他是 mammet 對吧？你不會真的相信那個是……」話說到一半，就被 Nashu 打斷。她急忙替 Gigi 說話，堅持他剛才對 Papa Hildy 講的那些重話，一定不是出於真心。如果不是，那就只剩一種可能──他其實把自己當成「Mama」了。這個念頭讓她嚇了一跳。</p>
<p>Hildibrand 則像是完全沒有被否定打倒，反而更加燃起鬥志。他坦然承認，為人父之路從來不會一帆風順，但身為 Gigi 的守護者，又是自稱「慈父 extraordinaire」的 Manderville，人就是要在這種時候迎難而上。他一定會想出辦法，跨過這道考驗，重新和心愛的兒子和好。Nashu 馬上附和，認為一個可以揭發竊賊、打倒決鬥高手，甚至還帶過 undead 大軍衝鋒的人，要處理一點小小「青春期叛逆」根本不算什麼。</p>
<p>Cyr 把「undead」那段硬生生從腦中刪掉，只認真抓住一件事：現在最重要的是找到那個 mammet。如果 Gigi 已經離開 Ishgard，他們越早知道越好。他提出行動方案：自己去 Arc of the Worthy 詢問守衛，Hildibrand 和 Nashu 負責飛空艇平台，而你則去工房附近的城門問話。等大家都打聽完，再在門邊會合交換情報。</p>
<p>在 Foundation 的城門，你從 Herewart 那裡得到關鍵線索。他記得一個戴著大沿帽的小不點──買了船票，搭上前往 Falcon’s Nest 的補給船。另一名守衛一邊含糊其詞地提到 Lalafell 的怪話，一邊又趕緊收回，說那只是「閒言閒語」。回到集合地點，Cyr 報告說沒有任何人從正門出城符合 Gigi 的特徵，Hildibrand 也表示飛空艇平台那邊沒有發現可疑乘客。唯一確實的情報，就是那艘開往 Falcon’s Nest 的船。Cyr 對再回到「冰天雪地的絕望之坑」感到非常崩潰，但 Hildibrand 毫不動搖──不論 Gigi 去哪裡，他都會追上去，找到他，再一次用父親的身分擁抱他。</p>
<p>在他腦中，Gigi 的目的地也不只是前哨陣地那麼簡單。Hildibrand 堅定宣稱，Gigi 回到那片冰雪荒野，只有一個原因──到雪地裡玩耍，把所有煩惱都拋向疾風。Cyr 當然不買帳。他還記得在 Jeweled Crozier，那個孩子用不可思議的魔力修復花瓶，卻在意識到自己「的確是 mammet」後，一整個陷入憂鬱與否定。對他來說，更合理的推論是：Gigi 想起了自己是什麼、是為了什麼目的被製作出來。</p>
<p>西部 Coerthas 一向被視為異端滋生地，他們最初就是在那裡發現 Gigi 的。Cyr 開始懷疑──Gigi 是不是回到「異端主人的地盤」，準備把在 Ishgard 蒐集到的情報通通報告回去。他一邊嗅著冰冷空氣，一邊興奮地說，自己終於聞到了「異端的氣味」。說完立刻催促大家動身，說現在還站在這裡幹什麼，有異端要抓。Nashu 聽了很不高興，悄悄對你說，她真的開始懷疑 Inquisitor Cyr 根本不喜歡他們的「小女孩」。</p>
<p>但 Hildibrand 不願意就這樣替別人下結論。他認為，在當事人沒有明確說出口之前，妄自揣測別人的心意是沒有紳士風度的。與其如此，不如慢慢地、悄悄地，引導對方認知到 Gigi 是個心地善良、單純的好孩子。「一切都要含蓄、優雅──這才是 Manderville 的方式。」他這麼告訴 Nashu。</p>
<p>一路往 Coerthas Western Highlands 深處前進，來到 Riversmeet 一帶時，Hildibrand 突然停下腳步。他指著雪地上的一串小小腳印，斬釘截鐵地說，那是 Gigi 留下的痕跡。Nashu 看得兩眼發光，說連腳印都好可愛，幾乎像某種 clockwork minion 踩過去的樣子。足跡往北延伸，沿著河岸繼續延長。Cyr 馬上把這當成自己推論的證據──mammet 離開前哨，就直直往北走去了，極有可能是要去跟異端接頭。</p>
<p>Nashu 的反應則完全不同。她不喜歡 Cyr 那種「早就認定有罪」的語氣，堅持說如果他們家的寶貝真的遇到異端，肯定會正面拒絕，轉身離開。就在這時，她突然「靈光一閃」，想起自己之前對 Gigi 說過的話──她曾提到 Grandpapa Godbert 一定會想親眼看看他那種神奇的修復能力。也許 Gigi 就是為了這件事，特別跑出來找祖父。Hildibrand 立刻把這當成完美推理，說這樣就說得通了：小朋友想見爺爺奶奶，是再自然不過的事。至於他先前才喊著「你不是我爸爸」，在他看來，只能算是「年輕人尋根、探索家族」的一部分。Cyr 聽完只覺得累，懶得再吐槽，只淡淡說了句「我真的懶得理了」，然後繼續往北追蹤足跡。</p>
<p>不久之後，你們在雪地裡找到失去動靜的 Gigi。帽子上黏著一大片碎冰，看起來像是被什麼小小又高速的東西狠狠砸中──一顆雪球。Gigi 抱著腦袋呻吟，看到是你們追了上來，略帶無奈地說了一聲「你們也來了」。Hildibrand 卻將這當成是「沒說清楚的家庭雪仗」，一邊慶幸他沒受傷，一邊說如果他早點提到要跟祖父母打雪仗，大家一定會樂意參加。</p>
<p>Cyr 反而注意到附近倒下的 steinbock 屍體，同樣被雪球砸中，看起來不像單純的「玩鬧」。他疑惑地問 Gigi 真的沒有損傷嗎？Hildibrand 完全不擔心，說 Manderville 可不是隨便被敲一下頭就會倒下的。他自己就曾被頭朝下種進地裡好幾十次，有幾次還是從高空直直摔下來，但他自認腦袋一點都沒變鈍。Cyr 才剛想說「地面可能不這麼覺得」，就發現眾人的視線突然越過他看向後方──Godbert 已經站在那裡了。</p>
<p>Godbert 很愉快地打招呼，說能在這個離文明那麼遠的地方碰見大家，真是幸運。他坦白自己剛才一直沉迷在和 Julyan 的決鬥中，所以沒及時注意到他們的接近，並且禮貌地問你們要不要一起加入比試。Gigi 一聽到聲音就立刻認出他，激動地喊著「Grandpapa Godbert！」，衝上前去，提起 Nashu 口中的「生與死之力」。他懇求祖父讓自己的生命真正「點燃」，讓自己變成一個真正的男孩。</p>
<p>Godbert 很慎重地確認：「你真的做好準備了嗎？也許會有點痛。」Gigi 毫不動搖地回答，他願意承受任何痛苦，只要能成為真正的人。Godbert 於是高舉 hammer，向 Byregot 祈求指引，正式開始敲擊。當鍛造完畢時，Gigi 低頭看著自己嶄新的身體，幾乎說不出話來。這就是他渴望已久的一切：完整的四肢、溫熱的血肉，完全符合他心中「real boy」的模樣。他興奮地向祖父道謝，說這個身體太完美了。</p>
<p>然而，Godbert 卻淡淡地表示，自己還「遠遠稱不上開始」，彷彿後面還有更多調整。就在一連串敲擊與調整之間，Gigi 在情緒高點時轉頭對 Hildibrand 大喊，說自己終於成為「Manderville man」。Hildibrand 眼眶發亮，張開雙臂呼喚兒子過來，說要好好看看他。兩人向彼此奔去──下一瞬間，巨大的衝撞聲在雪地響起。等白霧散去，只看到 Hildibrand 昏倒在地，而 Gigi 又變回原本小小的 mammet 姿態，站在一旁慌張地喊著「Papa Hildy 到底怎麼了」。</p>
<p>Cyr 看在眼裡，想到之前被修復的花瓶，只能驚嘆這幾乎是同樣的光景再演一次。Gigi 再度在瞬間把東西「還原成原狀」──只是這次換成了他自己。Hildibrand 緩過神來後，反而冷靜評估起來，說仔細想想，這一具原本的身體也許才是最適合 Gigi 的，至少「比較好照顧」。Nashu 毫不猶豫地補上一句，「而且可愛多了」。</p>
<p>但 Gigi 心中的結並沒有那麼容易解開。他小心翼翼地問，如果自己一直是 mammet 的模樣，真的可以被當成兒子接納嗎？原來這一直是壓在他心底的重量。Hildibrand 終於明白，這才是讓 Gigi 一直糾結的真正原因。他認真地告訴 Gigi：Manderville 的價值，不是由「肉體材質」決定的。所謂 Manderville，是活力、是體貼、是榮耀，是在任何季節都能像紳士一樣挺胸而立。無論你是人還是機械，只要擁有這些精神，就不會失去身為 Manderville 的資格。如果有人叫你 mammet，你就直視對方的眼睛，大聲說：「不，我是 Manderville mammet。」</p>
<p>接著，他轉向父母，正式說明自己已經在 House Manderville 的名義下，將 Gigi 登記為養子與家族保護對象，並為沒有提前告知而道歉。Godbert 聽完樂開懷，說他早就看出兒子很喜歡這個 mammet，卻沒想到喜歡到要當爸爸。當耳邊響起「Grandpapa Godbert」「Grandmama Julyan」這些稱呼時，他更激動地說，自己等這句話已經等很多年了。Hildibrand 則笑著說，人們常說「當祖父母是人生一大喜事」，他如今也算親身體會。</p>
<p>就在這歡樂氣氛最濃的時候，Julyan 出聲打斷。一句「到底有什麼好 grand 的？」立刻把笑聲壓下去。她斷然拒絕當什麼「mammet 的奶奶」，覺得是時候好好「敲醒」自家寶貝兒子，讓他認清現實。她的語氣裡既有怒火，也有一如往常的強勢。</p>
<p>在這整場鬧劇之中，Cyr 只能站在旁邊，看著自己的世界觀一點一點崩裂。他想起過去聽到關於 dark knight 的各種流言，卻又覺得剛才那一幕可能比那些傳說更可怕。就算有異端嫌疑，他也完全不打算拿自己的命去驗證。唯一可以確定的是，這一家人全都瘋了，他實在無法理解這樣的家族是怎麼爬到現在的位置的。</p>
<p>好在，至少那個 mammet 的「存在危機」看起來終於告一段落──這是他心裡唯一的安慰。但想到這裡，他又嚇了一跳，因為自己居然會用「存在危機」來形容一個 mammet。那明明只是人造物，為什麼他要在意它的感受？他猛然意識到，不能再這樣被帶偏下去。Manderville 的蠢勁會傳染，他必須守住自己的理智。於是他一邊自言自語，「遵守程序、向上級報告，一步一步來」，一邊逼自己冷靜下來。</p>
<p>回到 Foundation 之後，他向上司報告 Gigi 已經被 House Manderville 正式收養，並得到 House Fortemps 見證。但迎接他的並不是理解，而是一連串責備。他被指控「嚴重處理不當」，上頭依舊深信這個 mammet 是異端技術的產物，下令他強化調查，務必拿出「無可辯駁的證據」。</p>
<p>在實務上，這幾乎是不可能的任務。因為現在的 Gigi 已經完全放棄追尋過去記憶，轉而全心投入「Manderville mammet」的新生活。他每日守在 Papa Hildy 身邊，為任何可能變成「案件」的小事雀躍不已。Cyr 雖然並不真心認同上級那種「早已定罪」的態度，但他不能否認──這個 mammet 的確與眾不同。</p>
<p>你親眼見過：他在眨眼間讓一只古董花瓶恢復原狀，也用同樣的力道將自己從錯漏百出的「人類身軀」修回原本的形態。修復魔法並不少見，但 Gigi 所展現的力量，與 Cyr 以往見過的任何一種 reconstructive magicks 完全不同。眼前這個自稱「Manderville mammet」的存在，到底是誰、為了什麼目的被打造出來，他的故事顯然還遠遠沒有結束。</p>
