<p>Cyr greets you with a weary sigh, admitting that the night finds him in far poorer spirits than he would like. However much he loathes the idea, he sees no choice but to seek out Hildibrand and demand that he surrender Gigi to the inquisition. The mammet was unearthed under deeply suspicious circumstances, and to Cyr’s mind it may well harbor dangerous secrets—or even heresy. For the safety of the city, it must be examined, and if necessary, destroyed. Knowing how fond the inspector has grown of the contraption, he doubts the man will yield it willingly, and so he asks for your aid in persuading him. When you agree, he gives thanks to the Fury that at least someone here can see reason, and leads you toward the gazebo near Fortemps Manor, where Hildibrand and Nashu are said to often linger with Gigi in tow.</p>
<p>You arrive just in time to hear Hildibrand and Gigi trading grand declarations about scouring all creation, from the deepest pit of the seven hells to the very pinnacle of the heavens, in search of answers and adventure. Gigi echoes the words with childlike excitement, imagining a “grand adventure” in the lowest hells, while Nashu coos over how adorable “she” is. Hildibrand, beaming, declares that such daring dreams are the creed of Hildibrand, agent of enquiry, inspector extraordinaire, and praises Gigi’s dramatic posing, insisting the child has the makings of a fine inspector. Cyr chooses that moment to step forward, invoking the full authority of the Supreme Sacred Tribunal of Halonic Inquisitory Doctrine and commanding Hildibrand to surrender the mammet of suspected heretical origin. The inspector greets you cheerfully and dismisses Cyr as ever the jester, insisting that Gigi is plainly a precocious young lad, not some clockwork heretic. Nashu, meanwhile, chides him for confusing the “poor girl,” praising Gigi’s big boxy eyes as the very picture of femininity.</p>
<p>The argument over Gigi’s supposed gender is interrupted by the arrival of Count Edmont de Fortemps, who has come to ask why their commotion can be heard from the courtyard. Cyr hurriedly explains that he is here on inquisition business to seize the mammet, and that, after his perfectly clear explanation, the others chose instead to bicker about whether Gigi is a boy or a girl. Hildibrand turns the question on the count, who, after a moment’s consideration, declares Gigi to be a strapping young lad. Cyr all but throws up his hands, unable to believe that yet another respectable man has joined in this madness. Even if they insist Gigi is a “real boy,” he points out, the circumstances of his discovery and miraculous revival are far too unusual to ignore; the inquisition cannot allow him to roam freely until they are satisfied that he is no threat. Edmont seizes on the mention of “miraculous resuscitation,” and, after hearing the details, calmly proposes that Gigi be adopted as a ward of House Manderville until his memories return. He offers to stand as witness on the spot, confident that the inquisition would hesitate to endanger the cordial relationship between Fortemps and Manderville.</p>
<p>The suggestion leaves Hildibrand briefly flustered, before the full meaning sinks in—if Gigi becomes a ward of House Manderville, that would make him the boy’s father. With growing excitement, he accepts, loudly proclaiming that he, Hildibrand, agent of enquiry, inspector extraordinaire, grants this child the patronage of House Manderville. Gigi responds by calling him “Papa Hildy” over and over, while Nashu wipes away happy tears at the inspector finally becoming a father. Edmont, satisfied, notes that with the inquisition thus dissuaded, they are free to show Gigi more of Ishgard, and encourages them to do so in hopes that some familiar sight might stir his memories by the Fury’s grace. Hildibrand thanks the count profusely and hurries off with Nashu and his “beloved son,” leaving Cyr spluttering prayers to Halone and struggling to understand how everything has slipped from his grasp. He grudgingly concedes that if he cannot detain the mammet, he can at least shadow it, and resolves to observe Gigi closely.</p>
<p>Their tour of the city begins at one of Ishgard’s most imposing structures. Hildibrand proudly presents the building to Gigi as the grand manor of “House Durenmaeltempsarte,” mangling the names of the four High Houses into a single absurd portmanteau. Cyr, exasperated, corrects him at once: this is the Supreme Sacred Tribunal of Halonic Inquisitory Doctrine, his own place of work, and there is no such noble house as the one Hildibrand has just invented—least of all one that includes the very house that just vouched for his adoption. Nashu eagerly asks Gigi if the sight jogs any memories, but he can only shake his head and answer that nothing comes to mind. Hildibrand cheerfully pivots, suggesting that instead of showing him the grandiose, they should try something more ordinary and down-to-earth at the Holy Stables.</p>
<p>At Foundation’s famed chocobo stables, Hildibrand waxes nostalgic about halcyon days spent racing across the plains on chocoback, while Cyr mutters to himself, determined not to let the “heretic” out of his sight. Nashu, in her own world, speculates that if she wanted hair the color of Ishgardian chocobos, she might need to eat plums, valfruits, and pineapples, and wonders how many it would take. Hildibrand praises the chocobos as splendid specimens that could win races at the Gold Saucer under a skilled jockey, but Cyr sternly reminds him that these birds are the pride of the Ishgardian cavalry; any Temple Knight who dared misuse them would answer to the Fury herself. Nashu once more urges Gigi to look, listen, and even sniff the chocobos to see if anything stirs in his memory. He obediently sniffs the air, then sadly admits it did nothing. Cyr points out that just because Gigi was found in a Coerthan snowbank does not mean he hails from Ishgard, and then catches himself wondering if he has become complicit in this farce. When Hildibrand takes his frustrated muttering as inspiration to visit the markets and expose Gigi to goods from across Eorzea, Cyr can only groan.</p>
<p>At the Jeweled Crozier, a child begs his father to buy him a chocobo and nervously remarks on the strange-looking figure staring their way, prompting Gigi to wonder uneasily if he is truly that strange. Hildibrand admires the wares, noting that they would sell for a high price in Ul’dah, while Cyr laments how simple life once seemed—receive orders, detain heretics, meet quotas—even if his mentor’s “episodes” made it frightening at times. Nashu contemplates buying herself a nameday present with eyes closed, curious what she might end up giving herself. Gigi, sinking into discouragement, murmurs that there is no point, that it is no use. Hildibrand refuses to let him despair, reminding him that he promised days filled with grand adventures and the eventual recovery of his memories, and urges him to keep his spirits up. In the middle of one of his exuberant poses, however, he accidentally knocks an ornate vase to the floor, where it shatters. Cyr immediately blames his wild gesticulations and frets over how much the vase might have cost—only for Frine to inform them that it was over seven hundred years old, had passed through the hands of archbishops, counts, commanders, and a duke, and was last valued at one hundred twenty-three million, five hundred four thousand gil. Cyr practically chokes on the number and laments that Halone has forsaken him.</p>
<p>Then Nashu draws their attention to an unexpected sight: the vase, impossibly, restored. Cyr proclaims it a miracle, divine intervention from the Fury herself. Gigi hesitantly asks if he was the one who did it, and Hildibrand, delighted, declares that he must be a born artisan just like his grandfather. Gigi, curious, asks about “Papa Hildy’s papa,” prompting Nashu to explain that his grandpapa Godbert is the man who woke him with a few “gentle taps” of the hammer—someone said to wield the very powers of life and death. Once Godbert and Julyan return from their tour of the western highlands, she is certain they would be thrilled to see Gigi’s newfound talent. Cyr, unwilling to let the moment be dismissed as a trick, insists that they acknowledge this as a genuine miracle and a sign of the mammet’s power. Frine goes even further, offering one hundred million gil—and the now-priceless vase—in exchange for Gigi.</p>
<p>To Hildibrand, this is unthinkable. He is aghast that such a transaction could even be proposed and declares that Gigi is his flesh and blood; he will not sell him at any price. Gigi, however, can no longer ignore the truth. He begs “Papa Hildy” to stop, admitting that though he knows the inspector means well, they can deny reality no longer—he is a mammet. Hildibrand is shaken, insisting that Gigi is his son, a Manderville man, while Nashu counters that he is a Manderville girl through and through. Overwhelmed, Gigi cries out for both of them to stop, shouting that neither is truly his papa or mama. Cyr, catching the scent of something not quite heresy but dangerous nonetheless, resolves that such power must not fall into the wrong hands. Nashu winces that children can say the most hurtful things, while Hildibrand, ever hopeful, decides that this must simply be a rebellious phase. He recalls how he once tested his own parents’ patience and is confident that if they could weather the storm, so can he. Nashu suggests they should look into what has made Gigi so convinced he is a mammet. Cyr can only throw up his hands and exclaim that he is a mammet, wondering how they can fail to see it—and then, exhausted, gives up trying to argue the point.</p>

<p>その夜、シルは深いため息とともにあなたのもとを訪れた。彼自身の気分は決して上々とは言えず、それでも「どうにも他に手立てがない」と言うように、ヒルディブランドを探し出し、マメットであるギギを自分に引き渡させねばならないのだと打ち明ける。あのマメットは、あまりに怪しげな状況で発見され、奇跡的な復活を遂げた存在だ。何らかの秘密、あるいは異端に繋がる要素を内包していてもおかしくない。だからこそ異端審問は徹底した調査を行い、場合によっては破壊する必要がある、と。ヒルディブランドがギギに強い愛着を抱いているのは明らかで、素直に応じるとは思えないが、市井の安全のためには彼にも理解させねばならない──シルはそう語り、説得を手伝ってほしいと頼む。あなたが頷くと、彼はハルオーネに感謝しつつ、しばしばヒルディブランドたちが姿を見せるというフォルタン家近くの東屋へと足を向けた。</p>
<p>そこではちょうど、ヒルディブランドとギギが声を揃え、七つの地獄の底から天の頂きまで、あらゆる世界を駆け巡る大冒険について語り合っているところだった。ギギは歪んだ声で「七つの地獄のいちばん深いところでの冒険だ！」と無邪気に叫び、ナシュはそんな「彼女」の姿に目を細めて「なんて可愛いの！」と頬を緩める。ヒルディブランドは満足げに、これこそが自らの信条──紳士淑女の味方にして稀代の名探偵、ヒルディブランドの生き様だと誇らしげに名乗り、決めポーズを決めるギギを褒め称え、「いずれ立派な名探偵になれる素質がある」と笑う。その華々しい空気を断ち切るように、シルが前に出て、ハルオーネ異端審問院の権限において、異端の疑いあるマメットの引き渡しを命じると宣言した。</p>
<p>ヒルディブランドはあなたにひょうひょうと挨拶しつつ、シルを「相変わらずの道化だ」と軽くいなし、ギギはただの利発な少年であって、歯車仕掛けの異端者などではないと主張する。一方でナシュは、「またギギちゃんを混乱させて！」と抗議し、「あの大きくて四角いおめめこそ、女の子らしさの結晶なのに」と真顔で語る。どちらの言い分も受け入れ難いシルが頭を抱えていると、そこへフォルタン伯爵エドモンが現れ、「中庭まで声が響いているが、何事か」と問いかけた。シルは慌てて敬礼し、異端審問を代表してマメットを押収しに来たこと、そしてその説明をした途端、この場の面々がマメットの性別を巡って口論を始めたことを簡潔に報告する。ヒルディブランドは逆に伯爵へ問いを投げ、「ギギは少年か少女か」と尋ねるが、エドモンは少し考え、「明らかに健康そうな若者だろう」と答える。</p>
<p>シルは「世界中が狂ってしまったのか」と叫びたくなりながらも、仮にギギが“本物の少年”だと主張するとしても、その発見の経緯と“奇跡の蘇生”という事実はあまりに異常であり、脅威でないと判明するまで、町中を自由に歩き回らせるわけにはいかないと訴える。その言葉に、エドモンは「奇跡の蘇生」という表現に引っかかり、詳しく話を聞いたうえで、静かに提案を口にする。ギギが記憶を取り戻すまでの間、マンダヴィル家の庇護を受ける「養子」として迎え入れてはどうか、と。ここで自分が立会人となれば、フォルタン家とマンダヴィル家の良好な関係を損なうような行動を、異端審問も軽々には取れまい──エドモンはそう言って微笑む。</p>
<p>この提案に、ヒルディブランドはいったんたじろぐものの、すぐに意味を悟る。ギギを引き取れば、自分は父親になる。そしてその考えは、彼の胸を膨らませた。「もちろんだとも！」と叫び、紳士淑女の味方にして稀代の名探偵ヒルディブランドが、ここにギギへマンダヴィル家の庇護を与えると高らかに宣言する。ギギは「Papa Hildy」と繰り返し呼びかけ、ナシュはついにインスペクターが父親になった光景に目を潤ませ、「なんて素敵なの」と鼻をすすった。エドモンは満足げに頷き、これで異端審問を気にせずギギにイシュガルドの街を見せて回れるだろうし、フューリーのご加護があれば、どこかで記憶を呼び覚ますきっかけが見つかるかもしれないと勧める。ヒルディブランドは伯爵の厚意に深く感謝し、ナシュと「最愛の息子」を引き連れて勢いよく駆け出していく。</p>
<p>シルは、ハルオーネの御心を疑うまいとしながらも、「くそっ、何もかもが思い通りにいかない」と半ば祈り、半ば愚痴をこぼす。マメット本体を拘束できない以上、せめて行動を監視するのは自分の権利だと自分に言い聞かせ、ギギの後を追うことにした。こうして始まったのが、イシュガルド観光と記憶探しを兼ねた奇妙な小旅行である。まず訪れたのは、街でも屈指の威容を誇る建造物。ヒルディブランドは胸を張り、「こここそが“デュレンマルテンプサルト家”の壮麗なる邸宅だ」と紹介するが、その名はイシュガルドの四大名家の名前を無理矢理くっつけた、もはや悪ふざけに等しい造語だった。シルは即座に訂正し、「ここはハルオーネ異端審問院本部であり、そんな貴族の家名は存在しない。先ほど証人として立ちあったフォルタン家まで混ぜるな」と呆れながらたしなめる。</p>
<p>ナシュは早速ギギに、「何か思い出さない？」と問いかけるが、ギギは首を振り、「何も」と小さく答えるのみ。そこでヒルディブランドは「ならば、もっと庶民的な場所へ行こう」と方針を転換し、ホーリーステーブルでチョコボに会わせることを提案する。ファウンデーションの厩舎に着くと、ヒルディブランドは「若き日、幾度となくチョコボにまたがって風を切ったものだ」と懐かしそうに語り、シルは「焦るな、異端者は見張られているときほど妙なことをしない」と自分に言い聞かせながら、黙々と観察を続ける。ナシュは突然、「あんな色の髪になりたいなら、プラムとヴァルフルーツとパイナップルを食べればいいのかな……でも何個？」と真剣に考え込み、ヒルディブランドはイシュガルド産チョコボのたくましい体つきを褒め、「腕利きの騎手がいれば、ゴールドソーサーのレースでも優勝できる」と感心する。</p>
<p>しかし、シルは即座に「これらはイシュガルド騎兵隊の誇りであり、私利私欲のために利用すればフューリーの怒りに触れる」と釘を刺す。ナシュは懲りずにギギへ、「チョコボの匂いも嗅いでみて！　何か思い出すかも！」と促し、ギギは素直に鼻をひくつかせるが、結局「何も」と肩を落とす。シルは、「コースタスの雪原で見つかったからといって、必ずしもイシュガルド出身とは限らない」とぼやきつつ、自分もこの茶番に加担しているのではないかと、ふと我に返る。その隙を突くように、ヒルディブランドは「ならば、エオルゼア中の品物が集まる市場へ連れて行こう！」と、シルの独り言を都合よく解釈し、ジュエル・クロワジエへ向かうことを決めてしまう。</p>
<p>市場では、ひとりの少年が父親にチョコボの購入をねだり、「あの変な見た目のやつがこっちを見てる」と怯えた声を上げる。その言葉を耳にしたギギは、「あれは自分のことなのか」と不安そうに自問した。ヒルディブランドは陳列された品物を眺め、「この辺りの品なら、ウルダハでも高く売れるだろう」と商機を語り、シルはかつての仕事を思い返す。命じられた異端者を拘束し、ノルマを達成するだけだった頃は、師の「奇行」に怯えることはあっても、ある意味わかりやすかった──今ほど混乱してはいなかった、と。ナシュは「目を閉じたままひとつ選んで、自分への誕生日プレゼントにしたらどうかな」と楽しげに想像し、ギギは「どうせ無駄だ」と諦めの色を浮かべてつぶやく。</p>
<p>ヒルディブランドは、そんなギギを見て放ってはおけない。約束したはずだ──記憶を取り戻す日まで、壮大な冒険で日々を満たしてみせると。だからこそ、「気を落としてはいけない」と励ましながら、いつものように大きく腕を振り上げた……その瞬間、豪奢な花瓶が彼の動きに巻き込まれ、床へと叩きつけられてしまう。シルは「せめて周囲を見てからポーズを取れ」と怒鳴り、心の中ではその値段を想像して震え上がる。そこへフリネが現れ、花瓶の由緒と価値を語る。七百年以上の歴史を持ち、歴代の大主教や伯爵、総司令官、爵位ある者たちのもとを渡り歩いた逸品であり、その最新の評価額は一億二千三百五十万四千ギルだと。シルは思わずむせ込み、「ハルオーネよ、なぜ私をお見捨てに……」と天を仰ぐ。</p>
<p>ところが、ナシュが「あれを見て！」と指さした先では、砕け散ったはずの花瓶が、まるで何事もなかったかのように元の姿を取り戻していた。シルは「奇跡だ、フューリーのご加護に違いない！」と叫び、これは神の介入だと確信する。ギギはおそるおそる、「自分がやったのか」と尋ね、ヒルディブランドは「その通りだ、見事な腕前だ！」と大いに感激する。ギギには、どうやら壊れたものを修復する不思議な力があるらしい。彼は「Papa Hildy の Papa とは？」と問いかけ、ナシュは、彼を目覚めさせたハンマー使いこそ祖父 Godbert であり、その一振りは生と死すらも左右すると噂されているのだと説明する。西方高地の旅行から夫婦が戻ってくれば、きっとこの不思議な力を見て喜ぶに違いない──ナシュはそう無邪気に笑った。</p>
<p>しかし、シルはこの力を「手品」として片付けるつもりはない。今しがた目にしたのは紛れもない奇跡であり、このマメットが持つ力だと全員が認めるべきだと声を上げる。するとフリネが興奮気味に名乗り出て、「マメットを一億ギルで買い取りたい」と申し出る。いや、今割って今直ったばかりの“公爵家の花瓶”まで添えようと、値を釣り上げるほどだ。だがヒルディブランドにとって、これは論外である。イシュガルドの商習慣がどうであれ、彼にとってギギは「血の繋がった息子」であり、いかなる値段であろうと売り払うなどあり得ないときっぱり断る。</p>
<p>そのとき、ギギは静かに、しかしはっきりと口を開いた。Papa Hildy の好意はわかっているし、感謝もしている。けれども、もうこれ以上、真実から目を背けることはできない──自分はマメットなのだ、と。ヒルディブランドは動揺し、「何を言う、君は私の息子であり、正真正銘のマンダヴィル家の男だ」と否定するが、ナシュは逆に「マンダヴィル家の女の子だよ！」と主張し、言葉の綱引きはさらに混乱する。ギギはついに堪えきれず、「やめてくれ、どちらも自分の Papa でも Mama でもない」と叫んだ。</p>
<p>その一言に、シルは「異端とまでは言わぬが、この力を野放しにはできない」と、改めて危機感を覚える。あのマメットの力が間違った手に渡れば、何が起こるかわからないのだ。ナシュは「子どもって、ときどきものすごく傷つくこと言うよね」としょんぼりし、ヒルディブランドは「反抗期なら仕方がない」と、どこか自分自身の若き日を重ねるように語る。かつて自分も両親を困らせたが、それでも両親は嵐を乗り越えてくれたのだから、自分もまたそうあらねばならない、と。ナシュは、「まずは、どうしてギギが自分をマメットだと思い込んでいるのか、その理由を探ろう」と前向きに提案する。</p>
<p>しかしシルは、もはや返す言葉もなく、「だから最初からマメットだと言っているだろう」とだけ吐き捨て、これ以上、彼らの奇妙な家族ごっこに口を挟す気力を失っていたのだった。</p>

<p>這一晚，Cyr 帶著疲憊的神情找上你。他先是禮貌地問候，隨即坦承自己心情遠比表面難受得多。無論他本人有多麼不情願，事情顯然已走到一個地步──他必須主動去找 Hildibrand，說服對方把名為 Gigi 的「人偶」交給異端審問廳處理。這個 mammet 是在極為可疑的情況下被挖出來的，又牽扯到所謂「奇蹟般復甦」的事件，不知道藏了多少秘密，甚至可能與異端有關。為了 Ishgard 的安全，必須由異端審問深入調查，必要時甚至要將其摧毀。想到 Hildibrand 對 Gigi 的依戀，他也知道這絕非容易的要求，因此希望你能陪他一起去勸說。你答應幫忙後，他向 Fury 默默道謝，說至少還有人願意聽進道理，接著帶你走向 Fortemps Manor 附近的小 Gazebo──據說 Hildibrand、Nashu 和那個 mammet 最近常常在那裡出現。</p>
<p>你們抵達時，正巧聽見 Hildibrand 與 Gigi 以誇張的語氣宣示，要從七重地獄最深之處一路探索到天穹的頂點，為了尋找答案也為了追逐冒險。Gigi 用那帶雜訊的聲線重複著「最深的地獄裡的大冒險」，語氣充滿興奮，而 Nashu 則一邊看著他一邊發出感嘆，「是不是超可愛？」在她眼裡，Gigi 那雙大大的方形眼睛簡直就是女孩子魅力的象徵。Hildibrand 則大為得意，說這正是自己──「agent of enquiry, inspector extraordinaire」的信條，日子就該被這種像童話與傳說般的宏大冒險塞滿。他稱讚 Gigi 的擺姿勢非常有架勢，說不定未來能成為一名出色的名偵探。就在這個時候，Cyr 站了出來，堂堂正正報出 Supreme Sacred Tribunal of Halonic Inquisitory Doctrine 的名義，下令 Hildibrand 立刻將那個疑似異端來源的 mammet 交由他看管。</p>
<p>Hildibrand 彷彿只把這當作插科打諢的開場，先向你打了招呼，又把 Cyr 說成「一如既往愛開玩笑的查問官」，指責他居然把可憐的 Gigi 誣衊成什麼「發條異端」，明明一看就知道只是位早熟的少年。Nashu 則從另一個方向插話，責怪 Hildibrand 一直把「她」當男孩子搞得一團亂，說那雙漂亮又方方的眼睛明明就是最具女性魅力的地方。兩人一句男、一句女，讓 Cyr 只覺頭痛。正吵得不可開交時，Fortemps 伯爵 Count Edmont 出現了，問他們為何吵鬧聲連庭院都聽得一清二楚。Cyr 連忙向伯爵致歉，說明自己是代表異端審問前來沒收這個 mammet，這點他已經很清楚地告訴過 inspector，結果對方不但不配合，反而開始爭論起人偶的性別。</p>
<p>Hildibrand 乾脆把題目丟回伯爵身上，問他覺得 Gigi 是男孩還是女孩。Edmont 打量了一番後淡淡回答，「怎麼看都是精神飽滿的少年吧？」Cyr 幾乎想仰天長嘆，只覺得這世界是不是都瘋了。但即便大家堅持說 Gigi 是「真正的男孩」，他仍再度強調：這個孩子被發現的經過，以及所謂「奇蹟般地被敲醒」這件事，本身就異常到讓人無法視若無睹。在異端審問確認他不是威脅之前，不可能允許他在城市裡到處亂跑。Edmont 聽到「奇蹟復甦」的說法後，仔細追問了整個來龍去脈，隨即提出一個折衷方案──在 Gigi 找回記憶之前，乾脆讓他以 House Manderville 的被收養之子身份，暫時受其庇護。他願意就地作為見證人，如此一來，異端審問廳在行動時，自然要多考慮幾分 Fortemps 與 Manderville 兩家的關係。</p>
<p>這個建議讓 Hildibrand 一時說不出話。等意義完全消化後，他才猛然反應過來──若是收養成功，他就等於成為 Gigi 的父親。這個想法很快就讓他從驚愕變成興奮，他顫抖著重複「收養……也就是說，我會變成 Gigi 的父親？」然後立刻拍板，宣告自己──身為 agent of enquiry, inspector extraordinaire──願意將 House Manderville 的庇護授與這個孩子。Gigi 聽了立刻叫起「Papa Hildy」，一次又一次地喊，而 Nashu 則在旁邊感動到眼角發紅，「Inspector 終於當爸爸了，真是太感人了……」Edmont 見狀，便說既然異端審問的顧慮暫時消除，接下來他們就可以放心帶 Gigi 多逛逛 Ishgard，到處看看。說不定在 Fury 的庇佑之下，某個場景就會喚醒他遺失的記憶。Hildibrand 連忙向伯爵道謝，說這份恩情無論如何都不會忘記，隨即帶上忠實助手與「心愛的兒子」匆匆離去。</p>
<p>留下來的 Cyr 則抬頭向 Halone 自言自語，努力說服自己不要質疑神意，卻還是忍不住咬牙：「可惡，一切為什麼會變成這樣……」既然無法扣留 mammet 本體，他只好認真對自己說，至少還有權利「觀察」那東西的行動，於是決定一路尾隨，盯緊 Gigi 的一舉一動。就這樣，一場結合了 Ishgard 觀光與記憶探索的奇妙小旅程拉開序幕。</p>
<p>首先造訪的是屹立在石柱區的莊嚴建築。Hildibrand 豪氣萬千地向 Gigi 介紹，說這裡正是「House Durenmaeltempsarte」那偉大的宅邸──結果這個名字一聽就知道，是把四大貴族家名硬生生湊在一起的怪物。Cyr 當場糾正他，說那是 Supreme Sacred Tribunal of Halonic Inquisitory Doctrine，他自己每天上班的地方，什麼「House Durenmaeltempsarte」根本不存在，而且還把剛才替他作見證的 Fortemps 也混進去，未免太離譜。Nashu 則把焦點放回 Gigi 身上，期待地問他看了有沒有什麼印象復甦，然而 Gigi 只是輕輕搖頭，「什麼也想不起來」。Hildibrand 也不氣餒，說既然宏偉的建築沒用，那就換種路線，到更貼近日常的地方試試──下一站是 Holy Stables。</p>
<p>來到 Foundation 的著名馬廄，Hildibrand 看著一匹匹健壯的 chocobo，忍不住回憶起自己青年時代在風中奔馳的日子。Cyr 則在旁邊一次又一次提醒自己要有耐心，「正在被監視的異端通常不會立刻犯罪」，一邊牢牢盯著 Gigi，不讓他離開視線。Nashu 又被完全不同的事情吸引，她盯著那些色彩鮮明的 chocobo 羽毛，開始認真思考，「如果想要那樣的髮色，是不是該多吃些 plums、valfruits 還有 pineapples……但到底要吃幾顆才行？」Hildibrand 則感嘆這些 chocobo 都是極佳的「horsebirdflesh」，只要交給技巧高超的騎手，說不定在 Gold Saucer 的賽場上都能奪冠。</p>
<p>然而在騎兵的眼裡，這可不是可以隨便搬上賽道的賽馬。Cyr 立刻板起臉警告，說這些 chocobo 是 Ishgard 騎兵隊的驕傲，任何 Temple Knight 如果敢為了私利濫用牠們，就等著被 Fury 親自清算。Nashu 還是不放棄，催著 Gigi 仔細看看、聽聽、甚至聞聞 chocobo，也許會勾起某些回憶。Gigi 乖乖深吸一口氣，卻只能失望地說：「沒有……什麼都沒有想到。」Cyr 這才忍不住指出，就算 Gigi 是在 Coerthas 的雪堆裡被找到，也不代表他一定來自 Ishgard，話說到一半，他又突然意識到自己是不是也被捲進這場鬧劇裡，變成了某種共犯。偏偏 Hildibrand 立刻抓住他這句感慨中的關鍵詞，興致勃勃地說：「既然如此，那就去逛市場吧！讓 Gigi 接觸來自 Eorzea 各地的商品，說不定就有反應了！」於是目的地變成了 The Jeweled Crozier。</p>
<p>在那裡，一個孩子正纏著父親要買 chocobo，說自己想要一隻，接著又悄聲說那個「長得怪怪的傢伙」一直盯著他們看。這一句話落進 Gigi 耳裡，讓他忍不住自問：「那個長相奇怪的傢伙……是指我嗎？」Hildibrand 則在貨架間來回打量，感嘆這些貨物拿去 Ul’dah 一定能賣出好價錢；Cyr 則回想起以前的生活──接到命令、抓住異端、完成配額，那樣的日子雖然偶爾會被導師的「發作」嚇到，卻也比現在簡單太多。Nashu 則任性地幻想，如果閉著眼睛抓一樣東西，當作送給自己的 nameday 禮物，不知道會拿到什麼。Gigi 看著眼前那一切，心裡卻越來越沉重，只低聲說：「又有什麼意義呢……反正都是白費。」</p>
<p>Hildibrand 當然不能任他陷入沮喪。他提醒 Gigi，自己曾承諾要用一連串精彩冒險填滿他的日子，直到他找回失落的記憶為止，所以現在絕不能就這樣放棄。他一邊鼓勵對方振作，一邊像往常一樣大動作地比畫，結果卻在不經意間甩到附近的一個花瓶，硬生生把那件擺設掃到地上。伴隨著清脆的破裂聲，精美的花瓶被摔得粉碎。Cyr 當場臉色大變，指責他擺 pose 前至少該看一下四周，心裡則只剩「這要賠多少 gil」在打轉。很快地，管事的 Frine 趕了過來，面色蒼白地報告那個花瓶的身世：它已有七百多年歷史，曾在一位又一位 archbishop、count、lord commander 和 duke 的府邸中傳承，最近一次估價是 123,504,000 gil。Cyr 聽到這個數字幾乎喘不過氣來，只能一邊咳嗽一邊哀號：「Halone 啊，你為何拋棄了我……」</p>
<p>然而下一刻，Nashu 驚呼著叫大家看那邊。原本碎裂滿地的花瓶，不知何時竟完好如初地立在原位，就像從未遭受任何損傷。Cyr 大叫這是奇蹟，是 Fury 親自伸手干預的證據。Gigi 則有些怯生生地問：「那是……我做的嗎？」Hildibrand 反而興奮不已，稱讚這是與生俱來的才華，說 Gigi 簡直是天生的工藝匠人，就像自己的父親一樣。Gigi 接著追問：「Papa Hildy 的 Papa？」於是 Nashu 解釋，喚醒他的人正是 Godbert，那位只靠幾記輕輕的「敲擊」就把他從死亡邊緣拉回來的男人，有人甚至說他揮舞的那把 hammer 足以左右生與死。等到他與 Julyan 結束 western highlands 的旅行回來，一定會很想看看 Gigi 這個不可思議的「修復」技巧。</p>
<p>Cyr 卻不願讓這一切被當作單純的把戲。他嚴肅地宣稱剛才看到的是貨真價實的奇蹟，這個 mammet 擁有的力量絕對不容小覷，大家必須認真看待。Frine 更是當場出價，說願意用一億 gil 買下這個 mammet，甚至加碼表示連那個公爵級的花瓶也一併奉上，只求能得到 Gigi。對 Hildibrand 來說，這樣的提案完全無法接受。在他眼中，Gigi 是自己的「血肉之親」，無論 Ishgard 的商業交易再怎麼誇張，他都不可能用任何數字來衡量、也不可能把他賣掉。</p>
<p>就在這時，Gigi 主動開口打斷。那破碎又重建的聲線裡，帶著一種下定決心的冷靜。他說自己知道 Papa Hildy 是出於善意，也明白對方是真心在為他著想，但他們不能再繼續逃避真相──他就是 mammet。Hildibrand 像被針扎了一樣，反射性地否認，說 Gigi 是自己的兒子，是 Manderville 家堂堂正正的男子漢；Nashu 則照舊堅持他是 Manderville 的「好女孩」。Gigi 終於忍無可忍，大喊要他們兩個都住口，說他們都不是自己的 papa，更不是自己的 mama。</p>
<p>這一刻，Cyr 幾乎可以嗅到一股說不上是不是「異端」，但肯定非常危險的氣息。他心裡很清楚，這種力量一旦落入真正心術不正的人手裡，後果不堪設想。Nashu 則抱著胸口小聲嘆氣，「小孩子有時說話真的很傷人……」Hildibrand 從另一個角度解讀這件事，說 Gigi 不過是進入了叛逆期，他自己年輕時也不止一次把父母惹得心力交瘁，如果父母都撐過了那段風暴，他身為父親也應該能挺過這一次。Nashu 提議，與其在稱呼上爭論，不如去找出 Gigi 為什麼會那麼堅信自己是 mammet 的原因。</p>
<p>至於 Cyr，只能無奈地舉起雙手，感覺自己所有的吐槽早已用盡。他最後只丟下一句：「但他本來就是 mammet 啊，你們怎麼就看不見呢……算了。」然後在這場荒誕又奇妙的「家族劇」中，暫時選擇閉上嘴，繼續擔任那個既困惑又警戒的旁觀者。</p>
