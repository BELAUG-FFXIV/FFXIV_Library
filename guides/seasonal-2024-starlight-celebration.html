<p><b>Reach for the Stalls (00:00-07:30)</b></p>
<p>As the Starlight Celebration lights twinkle over Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre, you are stopped by a Miqo’te who greets you with a bright smile and a cheerful “Happy Starlight!” She introduces herself as Amh Garanjy, a celebrant for the festival, and explains that this year’s festivities include a brand-new attraction: a special market known as the Starlight Stalls. Merchants and artisans from all across Gridania have lent their cooperation, preparing unique Starlight-themed wares to delight visitors. The stalls are to be lit so that, from a distance, they resemble the stars above, a place meant for children and grown-ups alike to enjoy. Yet as she speaks, her smile falters. Preparations are badly behind schedule, and unless something changes, the market will not open as planned. Overwhelmed by the work still to be done, she asks if you might lend your aid and help her uncover the cause of the delay. When you agree, she thanks you warmly and bids you meet her at the market beyond the city walls, directing you to a nearby guide who will lead the way.</p>
<p>The Starlight Stalls guide recognizes you at once as Amh’s helper and offers to escort you out to the market. You follow along, leaving the familiar streets of Gridania behind until a new stretch of festooned stalls and half-finished decorations comes into view. Workers bustle about in the cold air, some rubbing their hands for warmth, others staring wearily at crates yet to be moved. When you speak with them, you quickly see the strain they are under. A Fen-Yll worker admits that they are not used to running open-air stalls, especially not in such biting weather. Baenfaeld explains that many celebrants have been dispatched to help because the stall keepers cannot simply close their regular shops; they are stretching themselves thin to support the festival, and the effort is taking a toll on everyone. A bleary-eyed worker confesses that they are nearly done with preparations and are now debating how best to bring in their wares, but the cold and fatigue make them long for nothing more than curling up to sleep. Even so, they push themselves to carry on, apologizing for the delay as they trudge back to their tasks.</p>
<p>When you return to Amh Garanjy, she listens attentively as you report what you have learned. Everyone is doing their utmost, you explain, but the burden of tending their own shops while preparing the stalls has left them exhausted, and the chill of the season only makes matters worse. Amh nods slowly, her brow furrowing in concern. If the workers are overtired and freezing, no amount of planning will be enough to see the preparations through; something must be done to revive their spirits and drive away the cold. She ponders aloud what might help—some small comfort to warm their bodies and hearts—while you suggest a treat to restore their energy, whether something sweet or a hot drink to cradle between chilled hands. The thought brings a spark back to her eyes, and she calls it a splendid idea, certain that such simple comforts would do much to lift everyone’s spirits.</p>
<p>Just then, a pair of familiar young voices calls out in greeting. Saulinne and Tenny run up, faces bright with excitement as they wish both you and Miss Garanjy a happy Starlight. They explain that the Starlight Celebration is their favorite time of year: the Saint of Nymeia brings presents, the city is dressed in beautiful decorations, and even the usually serious adults seem to relax and enjoy themselves. But this year, they noticed something different. The grown-ups are so busy preparing the market that they hardly look like they are having any fun at all. Worried by what they saw, the two children talked it over and decided they wanted to become little helpers and do their part. Amh’s expression softens at their earnest declaration. She praises their kindness as the very spirit of the Starlight Celebration and gladly accepts their offer of aid.</p>
<p>Turning back to you, Amh asks if you would be willing to work together with Saulinne and Tenny to help revive the weary workers. The celebrants will see to the cost, she assures you; all you need do is find something suitably revitalizing in Gridania and see that it is distributed among those toiling at the stalls. While you take on this task with your two small companions, she will return to the amphitheatre and inform the other celebrants of the situation. With that, Amh takes her leave, promising that you can always seek her counsel if you encounter difficulties. Saulinne and Tenny, meanwhile, bounce on their heels with anticipation, proudly declaring themselves little helpers and vowing to do their very best. Buoyed by their enthusiasm, you prepare to set off once more, determined to ensure that the Starlight Stalls will open as planned—and that the joy of the season will belong to children and grown-ups alike.</p>

<p><b>Spreading the Warmth and Cheer (07:31-)</b></p>
<p>Tenny beams up at you, full of determination, and promises that he and Saulinne will do their very best as little helpers. Saulinne, cheeks flushed with excitement, confesses that they had been eavesdropping when Amh Garanjy first approached you for help—they wanted so badly to become helpers that they listened to every word. Because of that, they already know how cold and tired the grown-ups are, and they’ve been thinking about what might cheer them up. Tenny chimes in that a hot, sweet drink like the one you suggested always warms him from his tummy to his fingertips. It’s how he survives winters in Gridania despite being from Ul’dah, where the air is far less biting. With that, Saulinne points toward the city and declares that you should all head to the Carline Canopy and ask Miounne for help with a drink, before darting off ahead. Tenny yelps and scrambles after her, leaving you to follow in their wake.</p>
<p>Outside the Carline Canopy, you find Saulinne already inside while Tenny lingers anxiously near the entrance. He admits that his parents warned him not to go into the Carline Canopy alone, so he chose to wait for you rather than risk getting in trouble. Once you step inside together, a cutscene unfolds: Miounne has already heard everything from young Saulinne and understands that you wish to serve something warm to the workers preparing the Starlight Stalls. The Canopy will have its own stall as well, but their preparations are already complete, and she’s more than happy to lend a hand. She disappears for a moment and returns with a cask of mulled punch—rich with fruit and spices, perfect for banishing the cold and weariness from aching bones. She also produces special seasonal mugs that the Canopy had planned to use for hot drinks, and asks that you use them to distribute the punch as a bit of promotion. The children thank her eagerly. Just then, a familiar voice rumbles through the room as the Saint of Nymeia appears, calling out to those who toil to make the Starlight Celebration wonderful. He invites you and the children to follow him, and outside reveals a chocobo dressed in festive barding, its back fitted with a basket and space for the cask. With a hearty chuckle, he explains that he has borrowed the bird from the stables and attired it for the occasion so that it may help you deliver warmth and cheer to the Starlight Stalls. Delighted, the children accept, and the Saint promises to see that they are dressed as proper little helpers as well, leading them off to be fitted while Miounne arranges to have the chocobo and punch sent ahead to the market.</p>
<p>Back at the Starlight Stalls, the air is still cold but somehow feels lighter. Workers from the Botanists’ Guild and other stalls continue their preparations, while the guide and celebrants move about the grounds. Tenny and Saulinne rush up to you in matching helper outfits the Saint has crafted for them, proudly showing off their new clothes. Saulinne marvels at how quickly the Saint took their measurements and produced garments fit for little attendants, while Tenny laughs and spins to make the fabric swish around his legs. A chocobo, decked out in its Starlight barding and harnessed with the cask of mulled punch, has also been brought over from the Carline Canopy, stamping its feet eagerly. Everything is now in place. The children explain that they have already filled several mugs and are ready to carry them around the stalls. They suggest splitting up: they will bring drinks directly to the workers on foot, while you lead the chocobo and its cask through the market so everyone can enjoy the punch while it’s still hot.</p>
<p>The eager chocobo lets out a bright cry as you take its reins, clearly keen to begin its appointed task. With the cask secured and the special mugs at the ready, you lead the bird through the Starlight Stalls, stopping wherever workers pause in their labors. A Fen-Yll worker greets you with surprise when you arrive bearing steaming mulled punch, then sighs in relief as warmth returns to frozen fingers. Baenfaeld looks up from his work, at first worried that Amh might have run into trouble, only to break into a grateful grin when he realizes you’ve come with hot drinks for the celebrants as well. Even the Botanists’ Guild worker, who had only glimpsed the children passing by, brightens as he accepts a mug and shares it with his comrades. Everywhere you go, the same reaction repeats: frost-numbed hands loosen around tools, shoulders unclench, and the aroma of fruit and spice briefly outweighs the smell of sawdust and cold earth. With each stop, the chocobo’s load grows lighter and the atmosphere around the stalls grows warmer, not just in temperature but in spirit.</p>
<p>When the last mug has been handed out, the workers gather their breath and thank you and the unseen “little helpers” who have been darting between stalls. A Bleary-eyed Worker remarks that the spices in the drink are enough to chase away his drowsiness, while you reunite with Saulinne and Tenny near the center of the market. The children are flushed with pride as they thank you—and the hardworking chocobo—for helping them see the task through. They report that everyone who received the punch is smiling again and that the setup is almost complete. Tools are being put away, decorations are nearly in place, and the Starlight Stalls are at last poised to open. Knowing how much this will mean to Amh Garanjy, the children look up at you and ask if you would return to Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre and bring her the good news.</p>
<p>You find Amh at the amphitheatre, having just finished assigning celebrants to assist stall holders with transporting their wares—a final effort to ease the burden on those who have already given so much of their time. When you recount how the mulled punch revived the workers and how the preparations are now all but finished, her face lights up with relief and joy. Without hesitation, she declares that she will head to the venue at once. Back at the Starlight Stalls, a final cutscene begins: the lights of the market glow against the winter sky, and Amh stands among the now-completed stalls, expressing heartfelt gratitude to you, the children, and even the faithful chocobo. Tenny cheerfully interprets the bird’s enthusiastic chirps as a proud “You’re welcome,” and Amh promises to see that their feathered friend receives a special delivery of gysahl greens. Saulinne, still full of energy, declares that helping out was great fun and that she hopes to do it again someday, while Amh gently tells the children that the celebrants will handle things from here and that they should go and enjoy the festival they helped make possible.</p>
<p>The children hesitate only long enough to turn the kindness back on her. Saulinne insists that Amh herself has been working just as hard as anyone and deserves a break, while Tenny adds that they should all share a little mulled punch together, while it’s still warm. Caught off guard but touched, Amh laughs softly and agrees, allowing herself to bask for a moment in the warmth she has worked so hard to spread to others. Later, after you and the children have gone off to explore the festivities, she makes her way to the stables to return the helpful chocobo. As she removes its festive barding, a folded note falls free. Addressed to “our not-so-little helper who helped little ones do big things,” it explains that the barding is a gift crafted for you by the Saint himself. When next you meet her at the stalls, Amh thanks you once more for everything you have done and presses the barding into your hands, insisting that you have more than earned it. With the Starlight Stalls now open and the guide ready to lead visitors to and from the market for as long as the celebration lasts, she encourages you to enjoy the fruits of your labor to the fullest, knowing that this year’s Starlight miracle was made possible by your kindness.</p>

<p><b>星芒祭の特別な市 (00:00-07:30)</b></p>
<p>星芒祭の季節、グリダニア：旧市街のミィ・ケット野外音楽堂では、星芒祭実行委員のアム・ガランジが忙しなく準備に追われていた。冒険者であるあなたが声をかけると、彼女は笑顔で挨拶し、今年は「星芒マーケット」と呼ばれる新たな催しを開く予定であることを語る。グリダニア中の商人や職人たちに協力を仰ぎ、星を思わせる灯りに彩られた特別な露店街を作り上げようとしているのだという。子どもたちはもちろん、大人たちにも星降る夜の特別なひと時を楽しんでもらえるはず──本来なら、そう胸を張って言えるはずだった。だが現実には、準備が思うように進んでおらず、開場のめどすら立っていないと、アムは不安げに打ち明ける。</p>
<p>理由を確かめるため、あなたは案内役の「星芒マーケットの案内係」に付き添われ、街の外れにある星芒マーケットの会場へと向かう。そこでは、冷え込む空の下、職人たちと星芒祭実行委員の面々が、テントや飾り付けの準備に追われていた。アム・ガランジは、あなたに周囲の作業員へ声をかけ、何が滞りの原因になっているのか確かめてほしいと頼む。あなたがベーンフェルドやフェン＝イルの職人、眠そうな顔をした作業員たちと話して回ると、皆が口をそろえて、慣れない青空市での準備に戸惑っていること、そして本来の店も切り盛りしながら星芒マーケットの準備をしているため、疲れが溜まりきっていることを打ち明ける。冷たい風が吹きつける中、眠気と寒さに耐えながら作業を続ける彼らの姿からは、星芒祭を成功させたいという思いと、その陰で無理を重ねている現状が、痛いほど伝わってきた。</p>
<p>報告を受けたアム・ガランジは、皆が星芒祭のために全力を尽くしている一方で、その負担があまりにも大きくなっていることに気づき、眉根を寄せる。このままでは、子どもたちに笑顔を届けるはずの祝祭が、支える側の大人たちから笑顔を奪ってしまう──それは、星芒祭の本意ではないはずだ。凍える手を胸の前で組みながら、彼女は、疲れ切った人々の心と体を温め、再び前を向かせてくれる方法はないかと、あなたに問いかける。あなたが甘いものや温かい飲み物で気分がほぐれると提案すると、アムはぱっと表情を明るくし、その案なら皆の心も体もきっと温まるはずだと嬉しそうにうなずく。とはいえ、具体的に何を用意し、どう配ればよいのか──彼女が考えを巡らせているときだった。</p>
<p>そこへ、ソリーヌとテニーという二人の子どもが駆け寄ってくる。彼らは、星芒祭が大好きで、星神に祈りを捧げる夜も、街を彩る飾りも、そして普段は忙しい大人たちがこの時ばかりは笑顔になる様子も、いつも楽しみにしているのだと語る。しかし今年は、準備に追われるあまり、大人たちに笑顔が少ないことに気づき、胸を痛めていたという。話し合いを重ねた二人は、自分たちも「小さな手伝い人」として、大人たちを助けたいと決めてここへやって来たのだ。アム・ガランジは、その優しさと決意に目を細め、これこそ星芒祭の精神そのものだと称える。そして、あなたが提案した温かい振る舞いを実現するため、グリダニアで皆を元気づける甘味や飲み物を調達し、ソリーヌとテニーと共に作業員たちへ配ってほしいと頼む。費用は星芒祭実行委員が負担すると約束したうえで、アムは同僚たちに状況を伝えるべくミィ・ケット野外音楽堂へ戻っていく。残されたあなたと二人の子どもたちは、「小さな手伝い人」として星芒マーケットに笑顔と温もりを取り戻すべく、準備を始めるのだった。</p>

<p><b>星芒祭と小さな従者たち (07:31-)</b></p>
<p>テニーは、あなたを見上げて「ぼくたち、ちゃんとお手伝い頑張るからね！」と胸を張り、ソリーヌも負けじと、優しく微笑む。彼女は、実はアム・ガランジがあなたに助力を頼んだときから、そっと話を盗み聞きしていたのだと打ち明ける。どうしても「従者さま」になってみたくて、二人で耳をそばだてていたおかげで、大人たちがどれほど寒さと疲れに苦しんでいるのかも、よくわかっているというのだ。そこで、皆を元気づけるものとして思い浮かべたのが、あなたが提案したような、甘くて温かい飲み物だった。テニーは、寒さの厳しいグリダニアで冬を越すたび、ウルダハ育ちの自分にはこうした飲み物が欠かせないのだと笑う。おなかの底から指先まで温かくしてくれるからこそ、冷たい風にも負けずにいられるのだと。そんな話をひとしきり語ったあと、ソリーヌは、「それならカーラインカフェに行って、ミューヌさんに相談してみよう！」と勢いよく言い出し、そのまま駆け出してしまう。テニーが慌ててその背を追いかけ、あなたも二人の後を追って歩を進める。</p>
<p>カーラインカフェの前に着くと、ソリーヌはすでに店内へ駆け込んだあとで、テニーだけが入口のそばでそわそわと待っていた。彼は、両親から「子どもだけでカーラインカフェに入ってはいけない」と言われているため、一人で中に入る勇気が出ず、あなたを待つことにしたのだと打ち明ける。やがて一緒に店内へ足を踏み入れると、カットシーンが始まる。ミューヌは、先にやってきたソリーヌから事情を聞いており、星芒マーケットの準備に励む人々へ温かい飲み物を振る舞いたいというあなたたちの願いをすでに承知していた。カーラインカフェも星芒マーケットに出店する予定だが、こちらの準備はすでに整っており、喜んで協力しようと言ってくれる。彼女は一度奥へ引っ込み、ほどなくして果実と香辛料をふんだんに使ったキンダープンシュの樽を抱えて戻ってくる。飲めば冷えと疲れを和らげてくれる、冬にぴったりの飲み物だという。そして、季節限定の特製マグカップを取り出し、本来は店で提供する予定だったそれを、宣伝も兼ねて星芒マーケットの人々に配ってほしいと頼む。子どもたちが元気よく礼を述べたそのとき、朗らかな声が響き、流れの聖人が姿を現す。星芒祭を支える人々に贈り物を届けに来たのだと告げ、あなたたち小さな手伝い人に、後に続くよう促すのだった。</p>
<p>店の外へ出ると、聖人は厩舎から借り受けた一羽のチョコボを披露する。星芒祭らしい装いの馬鳥装備を身にまとい、背には樽と荷籠を載せられるよう細工が施されている。このチョコボなら、先ほどのキンダープンシュの樽を運び、星芒マーケットで働く人々のもとへ温かい飲み物を届けるのにうってつけだと、聖人は誇らしげに語る。ソリーヌもテニーも目を輝かせ、ぜひ手伝わせてほしいと申し出ると、聖人はにこやかにうなずき、せっかくなら二人も立派な従者らしく装わなければならないと言って、採寸のために連れて行ってしまう。その間に、ミューヌはおしごとチョコボに樽を積み込み、星芒マーケットまで運んでもらう手配を進める。こうして、あなたは子どもたちが従者の衣装に着替えるあいだに、再び星芒マーケットへと向かうことになる。</p>
<p>星芒マーケットへ戻ると、冷たい空気の中にも、どこか柔らかな高揚感が漂っていた。園芸師ギルドの職人や各露店の働き手たちが、最後の飾り付けや準備に追われる一方で、案内役や星芒祭実行委員たちが会場を行き来している。やがて、ソリーヌとテニーが、揃いの従者衣装に身を包んで駆け寄ってくる。聖人に採寸してもらっている間に、あっという間に仕立て上げられたのだと、ソリーヌは頬を紅潮させて語り、テニーも新しい服の裾をひらひらと揺らしながら嬉しそうに笑う。そこへ、星芒祭仕様の馬鳥装備を身につけたおしごとチョコボも到着し、背中にはキンダープンシュの樽がしっかりと固定されている。カーラインカフェの協力もあって準備は万端だ。子どもたちはすでにいくつものマグカップに飲み物を注いでおり、自分たちも歩いて配りに行くから、あなたにはチョコボと一緒に会場を回ってほしいと提案する。温かいうちに、できるだけ多くの人の手に届けるため、ここで手分けをしようというのだ。</p>
<p>あなたが手綱を取ると、おしごとチョコボは「クェッ！」と高らかに鳴き、今にも駆け出したそうに足踏みをする。樽とマグカップをしっかりと確認したあと、あなたはチョコボを連れて星芒マーケットの中を巡り始める。フェンイルの職人は、祝祭の飾り付けに追われながらも、差し出された湯気立つキンダープンシュに驚きと喜びを隠せない。かじかんでいた指先に、じんわりと温かさが戻ってくるのを感じて、心から礼を述べる。ベインフェルドは、はじめこそアムの身に何かあったのではないかと心配そうに眉をひそめるが、あなたが持ってきた飲み物が自分たち星芒祭実行委員の分も含まれていると知ると、照れくさそうに笑いながらマグカップを受け取る。園芸師ギルドの職人もまた、先ほど子どもたちが何かを配っていたのを思い出しつつ、改めて差し出された飲み物に感謝し、仲間たちと分け合って飲むことにする。チョコボの背の樽が少しずつ軽くなるのにつれて、会場のあちこちでこわばっていた肩がほぐれ、香辛料と果実の香りが、冷えた木々や土の匂いをやわらかく包み込んでいくのだった。</p>
<p>すべてのマグカップが行き渡ったころ、作業者たちはあらためてあなたや「小さな手伝い人」たちへの感謝を口にする。眠たげだった作業員も、スパイスの効いた飲み物のおかげで目が覚めたと笑い、あなたはソリーヌとテニーと合流する。二人は頬を上気させながら、チョコボと一緒に働いてくれたあなたに礼を述べる。自分たちが配って回った先でも、皆が笑顔を取り戻し、準備もいよいよ大詰めを迎えているのだと誇らしげに報告する。飾り付けはほぼ整い、道具も片付けられつつあり、星芒マーケットはついに開場の時を迎えようとしていた。これだけの成果を知れば、アム・ガランジもきっと喜んでくれるに違いない──そう考えた二人は、あなたにミィ・ケット野外音楽堂まで行き、彼女を迎えに行ってほしいと頼む。</p>
<p>ミィ・ケット野外音楽堂に戻ると、アムは露店の品物を運ぶ負担を軽くするため、星芒祭実行委員たちに手分けして協力するよう指示を出し終えたところだった。あなたが、キンダープンシュがいかに作業者たちの心と体を温め、準備がほとんど完了したかを伝えると、彼女は胸を撫でおろし、安堵と喜びが入り混じった笑顔を見せる。そして、すぐに会場へ向かうと決意を告げ、あなたとともに星芒マーケットへと急ぐ。やがてカットシーンが始まり、冬空の下で灯りが輝く会場に立ったアムは、無事に開場を迎えた星芒マーケットが、多くの人々の協力と、あなたたちの温かな心遣いによって成し遂げられたのだと語り、深く感謝の意を示す。テニーは、おしごとチョコボの元気な鳴き声を「どういたしまして、って言ってるんだよ」と茶目っ気たっぷりに訳し、アムは、その働き者の羽根ある友にも特別なギサールの野菜を届けると約束する。ソリーヌは、手伝うことがとても楽しかったと目を輝かせ、またいつか同じように役に立ちたいと願いを口にするが、アムは優しく微笑みながら、これから先は星芒祭実行委員に任せて、二人には自分たちが支えた祭りを存分に楽しんでほしいと告げる。</p>
<p>しかし、子どもたちはそこで足を止める。ソリーヌは、アム自身もまた誰よりも忙しく働いてきたのだから、少しは休んでもいいはずだと真剣な表情で訴え、テニーも賛同して、皆で一緒に温かいうちのキンダープンシュを飲もうと誘う。突然の逆提案に、アムは一瞬目を丸くするが、すぐに柔らかく笑い、星芒祭の灯りの下で、ささやかなひとときを共に過ごすことを受け入れる。その後、あなたや子どもたちがそれぞれ祭りを楽しむために散っていくと、アムはおしごとチョコボを厩舎へ返すために歩を進める。チョコボから星芒祭の装備を外していると、その隙間から一通の小さな手紙がひらりと落ちる。そこには、「小さな手伝い人たちを助け、大きな仕事を成し遂げた立派な協力者へ」として、自らが仕立てた馬鳥装備を贈る旨が記されていた。後日、星芒マーケットで再びあなたと向き合ったアムは、あらためて感謝を述べるとともに、その装備こそがあなたへの聖人からの贈り物であると告げ、両手で大切に抱えていたそれをあなたに託す。星芒祭の期間中は、案内役の助けを借りれば、いつでもここへ戻ってこられる──そう言って彼女は微笑み、あなたに、心ゆくまで星芒マーケットを楽しむよう勧めるのだった。</p>

<p><b>星芒祭的特別市集 (00:00-07:30)</b></p>
<p>在 Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre 繞著星芒祭的裝飾漫步時，一道明亮的聲音向你喊道：「星芒祭快樂！」那是一位神情爽朗的 Miqo’te 女性，她自我介紹說自己是星芒祭的慶典負責人之一 Amh Garanjy。她告訴你，今年的星芒祭安排了一項全新的活動──一座名為「Starlight Stalls」的特設市集。來自 Gridania 各處的商人與工匠都響應號召，準備販售各式各樣以星芒祭為主題的特別商品。屆時，市集上會點起如同星空般的燈光，無論是孩子還是大人，都能在這裡找到屬於自己的歡樂時光。說到這裡，她的語氣卻忍不住沉了下來：準備進度遠遠落後，照這樣下去，市集根本無法如期開張。她被堆積如山的工作壓得喘不過氣，只能鼓起勇氣向你請求幫忙，希望你能協助調查延誤的原因。你一口答應，她便露出放心的笑容，請你稍後在城外的特設市集與她會合，並指示你先去找一旁的嚮導，由他帶你前往。</p>
<p>Starlight Stalls 的嚮導得知你是來協助 Amh 的，立刻表示願意引路。你跟著他離開 Gridania 熟悉的街道，來到一片尚未完全布置完成的市集區域。半搭好的攤位排成一列，燈飾與布幔還掛在半空，工人們在寒風中來回奔走，有人搓著雙手取暖，有人只盯著還沒搬完的木箱發呆。你依照 Amh 的提議逐一詢問，這才真正明白他們的處境。Fen-Yll 的工人支支吾吾地說，他們平常不習慣經營露天攤位，更不用說在這種刺骨的低溫裡工作。Baenfaeld 則解釋，為了不讓攤位老闆把原本的店關門太久，許多星芒祭的慶典成員都被派到這裡幫忙，因此每個人都在兩頭奔波，體力壓力自然愈來愈大。還有一位滿臉倦容的工人告訴你，他們的準備工作其實差不多完成，只剩下討論要怎麼把貨品運進來，但天氣又冷、人又累，只覺得隨時都會在現場倒頭睡著。即便如此，他仍然向你致歉，說完就硬撐著精神回去繼續動工。</p>
<p>聽完他們的訴苦之後，你回到 Amh 身邊，向她詳細報告剛才聽到的一切。她安靜地聽著，眉頭越皺越深。每個人都在竭盡全力，一邊維持自己的店鋪運作，一邊抽身來搭建市集，難怪大家都已經精疲力竭，再加上這種冷冽的天氣，工作怎麼會順利呢？如果不想辦法讓他們恢復精神、驅走寒意，就算計畫再周全，也無法順利推進準備。她一邊沉思，一邊喃喃自語著必須找到能溫暖人心又能回復體力的辦法。你於是提出自己的想法──如果是你，總會在吃到甜食或捧著一杯熱飲時覺得重新有了力氣，那麼，也許可以用類似的方式來提振大家的精神。Amh 聽完眼睛一亮，直呼這是個好點子，認為這樣的溫暖小小心意，一定能為辛苦的工作現場帶來笑容與活力。</p>
<p>就在兩人思索下一步該怎麼做時，一道熟悉又充滿朝氣的呼喊聲打斷了談話。Saulinne 和 Tenny 跑了過來，開心地向你和 Miss Garanjy 問好，祝你們星芒祭快樂。他們說，Starlight Celebration 是一年當中他們最喜歡的節日：Nymeia 的聖人會送來禮物，整座城市掛滿美麗的裝飾，就連平時嚴肅的大人們，看起來也像孩子一樣享受節慶的氣氛。然而，今年他們發現不太一樣的地方──大人們都忙著準備市集，臉上幾乎沒有笑容，看起來一點也不像在「過節」。為此，他們兩個特地討論了一番，最後決定要成為「小小幫手」，親自出力幫忙。聽完他們真心的告白，Amh 的神情變得格外溫柔，稱讚這正是星芒祭精神的體現，並非常歡迎他們加入行列。</p>
<p>接著，她轉向你，再次開口相託。希望你能和 Saulinne、Tenny 一起，想辦法幫這些疲憊不堪的工人們打起精神。具體需要準備什麼，就請你在 Gridania 探尋合適的甜點或熱飲，想辦法送到每一位正在努力搭建攤位的人手上，費用則由慶典一方全數負擔。她則會先返回 Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre，向其他慶典成員說明目前的狀況。如果途中遇到任何困難，只要來找她商量就好。Amh 說完便匆匆離去，而 Saulinne 和 Tenny 則興奮得幾乎跳了起來，一邊說著「我們要當小小幫手了！」一邊保證會拿出全力。看著他們純粹又熱烈的期待，你也不禁跟著振奮起來，暗暗下定決心：一定要和這兩個孩子一起完成這項任務，讓 Starlight Stalls 如期點亮夜色，讓大人和孩子都能在星芒祭的燈光下開心露出笑容。</p>

<p><b>傳遞溫暖與歡樂 (07:31-)</b></p>
<p>Tenny 抬頭看著你，眼裡滿是幹勁，認真地說他和 Saulinne 會好好當「小小幫手」。Saulinne 則有些不好意思地坦承，其實在 Amh Garanjy 一開始向你求助的時候，他們就躲在一旁偷聽——因為太想成為幫忙的大人，所以從頭到尾把對話都聽得一清二楚。也因此，他們很清楚大人們在這場 Starlight Celebration 準備裡有多冷、多累，一直在思考有什麼東西能讓大家重新打起精神。Tenny 接著說，只要是又熱又甜的飲料，就能從肚子一路暖到指尖。對一個從 Ul’dah 搬到 Gridania、怕冷又不習慣這種冬天的人來說，那正是他撐過寒冬的祕密武器。說到這裡，Saulinne 眼睛一亮，提議大家一起去 Carline Canopy 找 Miounne 商量飲料的事情，話還沒說完就已經朝城裡衝去。Tenny 慌忙追了上去，只留下你跟在兩個孩子的背影後面，一同踏上前往酒館的路。</p>
<p>到了 Carline Canopy 外頭，Saulinne 已經跑進店裡，只剩 Tenny 在門口猶豫地踱步。他小聲說，爸爸媽媽交代過不能自己一個人進 Carline Canopy，所以寧願在外面等你，也不要被人發現偷跑。你陪他一起走進店裡時，畫面轉入演出。Miounne 早就從 Saulinne 那裡聽說，你們想替正在 Starlight Stalls 裡準備的工作人員送上一點暖心的飲料。Carline Canopy 今年也要在市集裡設攤，不過店裡的準備早就完成，她很樂意幫忙。她先回到吧檯後方，過沒多久便抱著一桶 mulled punch 回來——混合果實與香料的熱飲，最適合驅趕寒氣與疲憊。她又拿出特製的季節馬克杯，原本打算在自家店裡販售，現在乾脆交給你們，一邊派送飲料、一邊幫 Carline Canopy 宣傳。孩子們連忙向她道謝。就在這時，一個熟悉而渾厚的聲音響起，Saint of Nymeia 現身，對為 Starlight Celebration 忙碌的眾人送上祝福，並邀請你和兩位「小小幫手」跟著他走。</p>
<p>在店外，Saint of Nymeia 展示了他從馬廄借來的 chocobo。那隻鳥披著應景的節慶 barding，背上特別安裝了籃子與固定桶子的架子，正是用來運送 mulled punch 的最佳夥伴。他笑著說，這樣就能把熱騰騰的飲料送到 Starlight Stalls 每一個辛苦工作的人手中。聽到這番話，Saulinne 和 Tenny 立刻答應幫忙，興奮得幾乎要跳起來。Saint of Nymeia 則說，既然要當小幫手，就得有像樣的衣服，隨即帶著兩人去量身、準備裝扮。留下 Miounne 在 Carline Canopy 裡忙著將 mulled punch 裝好，交給工作人員牽著 chocobo 一起送往 Starlight Stalls，而你則先行返回市集，準備和兩位換上新衣的小幫手會合。</p>
<p>回到 Starlight Stalls，空氣依舊冰冷，但氣氛已經輕快許多。Botanists’ Guild 的工人和其他攤位的工作人員還在趕工，調整擺設、確認最後的裝飾，Starlight Stalls Guide 和 celebrants 來回穿梭協調。沒多久，換上成套小幫手服裝的 Saulinne 和 Tenny 一路跑向你，驕傲地展示身上的新衣。Saulinne 說 Saint of Nymeia 只量了一下身高，很快就做出這麼合身的衣服，Tenny 則一邊轉圈一邊讓衣擺晃動，笑得合不攏嘴。Carline Canopy 的人也已經把那隻裝飾好的 chocobo 牽到場內，背上的 mulled punch 木桶固定穩妥，牠則興奮地在原地踏步。現在，一切準備就緒。孩子們說他們已經先把幾個馬克杯裝滿，準備親自拿去發給附近的攤位，並提議由你負責帶著 chocobo 繞場，把熱飲送到更多人的身邊，好讓大家在熱度還沒散去前都能喝上一口。</p>
<p>當你握住韁繩，那隻「Eager Chocobo」立刻開心地叫了兩聲，彷彿迫不及待要開始工作。你一面牽著牠，一面在 Starlight Stalls 的小路之間來回，停在每一個辛苦忙碌的身影面前。Fen-Yll Worker 在冷風中忙著擺放商品，見到你端來冒著熱氣的 mulled punch，先是愣了一下，接著伸出凍得僵硬的手捧起馬克杯，喝下第一口時忍不住發出感嘆。Baenfaeld 起初還以為 Amh 出了什麼事，神情緊張地詢問你情況，得知你是來替 celebrants 送上飲料後，臉上的線條鬆開，露出既感激又有些害羞的笑容。Botanists’ Guild Worker 回想起剛才看到兩個孩子拿著馬克杯穿梭攤位的身影，這次則直接接過你遞上的熱飲，說這正是他們撐完最後一段準備所需要的東西，並打算和同伴一起分享。隨著 chocobo 背上的木桶越來越輕，市集中被冷風吹得僵硬的肩膀也一個個放鬆下來，果香與香料的氣味漸漸壓過潮濕泥土和木材的味道，讓整個 Starlight Stalls 都蒙上一層柔和的暖意。</p>
<p>當最後一杯 mulled punch 送到人們手裡，工作人員紛紛向你以及兩位「小小幫手」致謝。Bleary-eyed Worker 說飲料裡的香料正好把他的睡意全都趕走，你則在約定的地方和 Saulinne、Tenny 重新會合。兩人臉頰通紅，興奮地向你和辛苦拉著木桶的 chocobo 表示感謝，說大家在喝到熱飲之後，不只手腳暖了起來，臉上的表情也都明顯輕鬆了許多。現在，各攤位差不多都完成了準備，Starlight Stalls 終於要開幕了。想到 Amh Garanjy 聽到這個消息時的表情，兩個孩子抬頭看著你，希望你能回到 Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre，親自把好消息帶給她。</p>
<p>當你回到 Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre 時，Amh 正在安排 celebrants 分頭協助攤位搬運貨物，好讓攤主們不要再負擔太多。聽你說起 mulled punch 怎麼讓大家重新振作、準備工作也已經接近尾聲，她露出如釋重負的笑容，眼裡滿是喜悅。她毫不猶豫地表示要立刻前往 Starlight Stalls。很快地，你們一起回到市集，畫面轉入演出。燈光在冬夜裡柔和地閃爍，攤位一字排開，Amh 站在其中，難掩心中的感動，說這一切都要歸功於你們送去的那份溫暖——不只是一桶熱飲，而是所有人想讓這場 Starlight Celebration 成功的心意。她衷心向你們致謝。Tenny 看著那隻忙前忙後的 chocobo，笑著說牠大概是在說「不客氣」，Amh 則答應會特別準備一份 gysahl greens 送到馬廄，慰勞這位羽毛朋友。Saulinne 說自己很喜歡這次幫忙的經驗，希望將來還有機會成為這樣的小幫手，而 Amh 則溫柔地回應，接下來就交給 celebrants 處理，兩個孩子應該去好好享受自己親手幫忙完成的祭典。</p>
<p>然而，孩子們並沒有馬上跑開。Saulinne 認真地說，Amh 自己也一直忙到現在，應該要好好休息一下才行；Tenny 則附和說，那就大家一起再喝一點 mulled punch，在變冷之前好好享受。突如其來的貼心讓 Amh 一時語塞，隨即被逗笑。她答應了這個邀請，在 Starlight Stalls 的燈光下，和你們一起共享這短暫而溫暖的片刻。之後，當你和孩子們各自散開、投身熱鬧的市集時，她獨自帶著那隻辛苦的小幫手 chocobo 回到馬廄。卸下 festive barding 的時候，一張對摺的小紙條從裝備的縫隙間掉了出來。紙上寫著：「送給那位幫助小小幫手、一起完成大事的『不那麼小的幫手』，這是我親手製作的禮物。」落款不用看也知道，是 Saint of Nymeia 留下的訊息。</p>
<p>稍後，當你再次在 Starlight Stalls 和 Amh 見面時，她再次向你道謝，並把那套 barding 交到你手上，說這是聖人特別託付給你的禮物——你已經用實際行動證明，自己值得這份象徵幫手身份的裝備。現在，Starlight Stalls 正式開張，只要活動還在進行，Starlight Stalls Guide 就會隨時帶你往返於 Gridania 與市集之間。Amh 帶著笑意請你放心地去逛逛，多多享受這個由你親手參與、親自守護的 Starlight Celebration。</p>
