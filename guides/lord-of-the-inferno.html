      <p>At the Waking Sands, Minfilia summons you once more to the Solar. Word has arrived from Thancred regarding the investigation in Thanalan: he has wrung new information out of Ungust, the false priest. Ungust is due to meet with the Amalj’aa to discuss their ongoing arrangements, and the Immortal Flames judge this clandestine parley to be the perfect chance to lay an ambush and seize the lizardmen behind the abductions. They intend to let Ungust attend the meeting as planned, then strike. Knowing the Amalj’aa will not yield without a fight, the Flames have requested the Scions’ support. Minfilia asks you to be their representative on the ground until Thancred can rejoin you, passing on his light-hearted message to “save some for him.” His easy confidence in your strength mirrors her own. Once you are ready, she bids you travel to Camp Drybone and report to the flame sergeant in charge, sending you forth with a final blessing: may you walk in the light of the Crystal.</p>
      <p>At Camp Drybone, the flame sergeant greets you by name and thanks you for coming, making no secret of how much your presence bolsters the small force he commands. He briefs you on the mission: the objective is to capture Amalj’aa warriors and wrest from them the whereabouts of the abducted victims. The Amalj’aa still believe Ungust is their loyal contact and have no inkling that his treachery has been exposed; when they arrive at the rendezvous to meet him, the Flames will spring their trap. Because of the operation’s secrecy, only a small contingent can be deployed, and so the aid of the Scions is all the more precious. The meeting point is an ancient ruin known as the Invisible City. You are to make your way there and lie in wait. When you reach the site, the sergeant confirms that the “bait” is in place and that their man stands ready. The moment the Amalj’aa appear, he gives the order to move. For a heartbeat, everything goes according to plan—until a wrongness creeps in. Ungust’s shrill laughter cuts through the air, and in the next instant a flame soldier turns on his comrades, his own mad cackle joining Ungust’s. The traitor reveals himself openly, boasting that the ambush ends here. Ungust admits that he evaded the Immortal Flames for moons before his capture because someone inside was feeding him information, and the traitor echoes the confession with crude delight. Your every movement has been known to them in advance. With mocking courtesy, they hand you and the others over to the waiting Amalj’aa, and you are forced into battle against the lizardmen.</p>
      <p>Though you prevail against the warriors who rush to meet your steel, the tide soon turns. In the chaos that follows, a traitorous soldier seizes one of your comrades and presses a blade to his throat, demanding that you lay down your weapon or watch the man die. Even as a private tries to shout a warning from behind, Ungust orders the captives brought forward. The traitor commands the rest of you to march, and those still standing are herded away at spearpoint. You are taken south into the desert, led through hostile sands to the Amalj’aa stronghold of Zanr’ak. There, in the shadow of rough stone and crude altars, you find yourself penned in with the surviving Flames. One private breaks down completely, sobbing that the lizardmen will surely kill you all and that he only wants to go home. Another explains in a shaking voice that the Amalj’aa marched you straight into their territory and seem to be preparing something—something he wants no part of when it reaches its terrible conclusion. The sergeant, jaw set, voices the fear that you will be given to the Amalj’aa’s god as offerings; if he must die, then he would rather fall with a weapon in hand than on his knees. Cursing the existence of a traitor in the Immortal Flames and lamenting what has become of his order, he apologizes to you. Had he been a better judge of character, he says, you would never have been dragged into this mire.</p>
      <p>What follows in Zanr’ak—the summoning of Ifrit, your forced audience with the Lord of the Inferno, and the impossible battle you somehow survive—leaves no one unchanged. When at last you make it back to Camp Drybone, scorched in body and spirit, you find Thancred waiting. He invites you to rest while you can, noting that after witnessing their god’s ignominious defeat, the Amalj’aa will be less eager to provoke your wrath, at least for a time. Then he turns to you with an apology. He arrived too late to be of any use, he says—too late to prevent your capture, too late to stop the Amalj’aa from offering you up to Ifrit alongside the abductees. Those taken with you may be whole in body, but their minds are another matter; once a man is tempered, he reminds you, the change is absolute. Thancred catches himself before he sinks too deeply into grim reflection. It does not suit him to dwell only on darkness when there is something to celebrate. Ifrit is dead, and the one who struck him down was you. That achievement is no small feat. He insists that he never thought you ordinary; on the contrary, he has long suspected that you possess the potential to shape the fate of the realm, and this victory only confirms his eye for talent. He asks your leave to carry the tale back to Minfilia, so that he may at least claim to have contributed something to the mission. You, meanwhile, have earned a respite. He advises you to take what rest you can and return to the Waking Sands when you feel ready, warning with a wry smile that the realm’s troubles will not solve themselves.</p>
      <p>When you return to the Waking Sands, a fellow Scion greets you at the entrance hall as a triumphant hero. Thancred has already arrived ahead of you with the news of Ifrit’s fall and is in the Solar, giving Minfilia a full report. You are urged to join them at once, for she is eager to see you. In the Solar, you arrive just in time to hear Thancred confessing his failings to his leader. He blames himself for not being there when the Amalj’aa took you prisoner and for failing to prevent you from being offered up to Ifrit. Though you survived by some miracle, he insists, you should never have been forced to stand alone against such danger, and he feels that he has failed both you and the Scions. Minfilia starts to tell him that what is done is done, but her words trail off as she turns and sees you in the doorway. Crossing the room, she greets you warmly and tells you how glad she is to see you returned. Thancred, his tone a little lighter now, remarks that he has just finished regaling her with your exploits. Between them, they explain that their long investigation has finally reached its conclusion: as suspected, the Amalj’aa carried out both the crystal robbery and the abductions with the intent of summoning their primal, Ifrit. Nor is this kind of tale unique to Ul’dah. Similar incidents have been occurring in Limsa Lominsa and Gridania as well.</p>
      <p>Sensing your unspoken questions, Thancred offers a more detailed explanation. Once a primal manifests in the physical realm, it must consume aether in order to remain. The stronger it becomes, the more aether it requires. Aether exists in all things: it flows through every living being and even suffuses the air you breathe. Yet this diffuse energy alone cannot sustain a being like Ifrit. To endure, primals crave a concentrated source of aether—crystals. That is why so many crimes involving crystals can be traced back to primals, Minfilia adds. As for the abductions, their purpose is bound up with the way primals are born. When the world is ordered and calm, primals possess no physical form; their essence is scattered along the great river of aether. But when chaos grips the land and their worshippers cry out in desperation for deliverance, those prayers act as a beacon. The primal’s essence is drawn toward that beacon and coalesces into a vessel of flesh—a process the Scions call aetheric coalescence. Once thus incarnate, a primal feeds upon worship; the more numerous and fervent its followers, the more powerful the god becomes.</p>
      <p>Yet primals are seldom content with the reverence mortals give of their own free will. To swell their ranks, they create new followers by “tempering” those they capture—a process you yourself have now endured. Even as Ifrit bent your comrades and the captured Flames to his will, you alone stood unbowed. Minfilia explains that this is thanks to the power you possess: the Echo. The Scions do not yet know why, but those blessed with the Echo are immune to a primal’s influence, as though some greater power shields them from enthrallment. When you first came to them, she told you that the Echo would be instrumental in meeting the primal threat; now, in the wake of Ifrit’s attempted tempering, you can see why. Thancred notes that the recent incidents all share a common trait: meticulous planning. Such elaborate designs are a new…and troubling…development, one that fills him with a sense of foreboding that he cannot easily shake. Minfilia shares his concern, but for the moment her overriding feeling is relief that you have returned alive.</p>
      <p>She informs you that the Immortal Flames will see to the aftermath of the operation, so you need not burden yourself with those details. For a short while, at least, you may rest easy. She encourages you to make full use of this respite, warning that once the people learn that it was you who struck down Ifrit, you will have precious little time to yourself. After you withdraw, Thancred seeks you out again. He points out, gently, that Minfilia neglected to mention something—whether by design or simple omission. He believes it best that you hear it from him. The tempered abductees rescued from Ifrit’s clutches, including the Flames who were captured with you, are all to be put to death. This decision, he says, must remain secret; the public must never know. He swears that they would never do such a thing if there were any alternative, but once a man is tempered, he is tempered for life. His very existence feeds power back to the primal he cannot help but worship. As long as he lives, he is a conduit of strength to a god who would see the realm undone. It is in order to prevent more such sacrifices that the Scions continue their fight, and Thancred expresses the hope that you will stay at their side. Then he takes his leave to offer his apologies to the Flame General for the soldiers lost under his watch. Left alone, he quietly questions how many more lives will be spent before this struggle ends and laments that Louisoix would never have allowed things to come to this. For his part, he resolves that he must do better, must grow stronger, if he is to be worthy of the faith you and the others have placed in him.</p>

      <p>「砂の家」の執務室で、ミンフィリアは再びあなたを呼び寄せる。サンクレッドから、ザナラーンで続いていた一連の調査に関する続報が届いたというのだ。偽の司祭ウングストから新たな情報を引き出すことに成功した結果、彼がアマルジャ族との取引について話し合う会合に出向く手筈になっていることが判明した。不滅隊は、この極秘の会合こそが、人さらいの黒幕であるアマルジャ族を一網打尽にする絶好の機会だと判断し、ウングストには予定どおり顔を出させるつもりでいる。ただし、アマルジャ族が容易に捕まるはずもなく、激しい抵抗が予想されるため、彼らは暁の血盟にも支援を要請してきた。ミンフィリアは、サンクレッドが現地に合流するまでのあいだ、あなたを暁の唯一の代表として派遣したいと告げる。出発前、彼女は「少しは自分の分も残しておいてほしい」と伝言を託したサンクレッドの軽口を伝え、その言葉に込められた信頼が自分の気持ちとも重なっていると微笑む。支度が整い次第、キャンプ・ドライボーンへ赴き、任務の指揮を執る不滅隊の軍曹に報告してほしい──最後にそう言い添え、クリスタルの加護があらんことをと送り出すのだった。</p>
      <p>キャンプ・ドライボーンに到着すると、不滅隊の軍曹があなたを出迎える。彼は、暁の血盟の一員であるあなたが力を貸してくれたことに深く礼を述べ、少数精鋭で挑まねばならない今回の任務において、その存在がいかに心強いかを率直に語る。そして本作戦の概要を説明する。目的は、アマルジャ族の戦士たちを捕縛し、さらわれた人々の行方を吐かせること。アマルジャ族は、ウングストが裏切り者として露見した事実をまだ知らない。ゆえに、裏取引のために彼と落ち合おうと姿を現したところを狙い、罠を張って一気に襲いかかる算段だという。作戦は極秘裏に進められているため、大部隊を動かすことはできず、一人ひとりの力がより重要になる。だからこそ、暁の助力が求められているのだ。会合の場所は「インビジブル・シティ」と呼ばれる古い遺跡地帯。あなたは先行して現地へ向かい、潜んで待つよう命じられる。指定された場所に着くと、軍曹はまず「餌」が所定の位置にいるかを確認し、私兵から「配置についた」との報告を受ける。アマルジャ族が現れ次第、すぐに動く──そう命令が下された矢先、事態は急速に不穏な方向へ傾き始める。ウングストが不気味な笑い声をあげ、それと呼応するように、一人の不滅隊員が仲間に刃を向けて高笑いを始めたのだ。裏切り者は正体を明かし、ここで罠にかけられるのは自分たちのほうだと嘲笑する。ウングストは、これまで幾月にもわたって不滅隊の追及を逃れてきたのは、内通者から情報を受け取っていたからだと白状し、裏切り者もまた下品な笑いとともにそれを認める。あなた方の動きは、すべて事前に知られていたのだ。やがて二人は、あとは任せたと言わんばかりにあなたたちをアマルジャ族に引き渡し、待ち構えていたトカゲたちとの戦闘が始まる。</p>
      <p>押し寄せるアマルジャ族の戦士たちを撃退したものの、その後の混乱の中で状況は一変する。裏切り者の不滅隊員が仲間のひとりを捕らえ、喉元に刃を突きつけて武器を捨てるよう脅しをかけてきたのだ。背後から注意を促そうとする兵士の声もむなしく、ウングストは捕らえられた者を引き立たせ、残りの者たちには行軍を命じる。抵抗する術もなく、あなたを含む生存者は槍を突きつけられたまま連行されていく。行き着いた先は、ザナラーンの南に位置するアマルジャ族の拠点ザンラーク。粗野な石造りの施設と祭壇が並ぶその地で、あなたは捕えられた不滅隊員たちとともに封じ込められることになる。ひとりの二等兵は完全に取り乱し、「きっと自分たちは殺される」と怯えながら、ただ家に帰りたいと子どものように泣きじゃくる。別の兵士は、アマルジャ族が自分たちをこの本拠地まで連行し、何かの準備を進めているようだと震える声で語る。その「何か」が完了する瞬間に立ち会いたくはない、と。軍曹は強く歯を食いしばり、アマルジャ族が自分たちを神への供物として捧げるつもりなのだろうと憂慮する。どうせ死ぬなら、せめて剣を手にしたまま兵士として倒れたい──そう言って、組織の中に裏切り者がいたという事実に激しい怒りと失望をにじませる。こんなことになってしまったのは、自分の人を見る目が足りなかったせいだと、彼はあなたに詫びるのだった。</p>
      <p>その後ザンラークで起こる出来事──アマルジャ族による蛮神イフリートの召喚、あなたが炎獄の王の前に連れ出され、常人なら到底逃れられないはずの試練をくぐり抜けたこと──は、誰にとっても忘れがたい体験となる。やがて、辛くも生還を果たしてキャンプ・ドライボーンへ戻ったあなたを、サンクレッドが出迎える。彼は、今のうちに休めるだけ休んでおけと勧めたうえで、蛮神の惨めな敗北を目の当たりにしたアマルジャ族も、しばらくのあいだは暁の逆鱗に触れるような行動を控えるだろうと告げる。そして、遅れて到着したことへの謝罪の言葉を口にする。捕らえられたあなたを救うことも、アマルジャ族があなたをイフリートへの供物として差し出すのを止めることもできなかった──彼は自分が間に合わなかったせいで、あなたがひとりで過酷な危険に立ち向かわされることになったと悔やんでいる。共に囚われていた者たちは、肉体こそ無事でも精神までは救えなかった。いったんテンパードにされた者は、もう元には戻らないのだから。だが、彼はすぐに暗い思考に囚われるのをやめる。悪いほうばかり見ていても仕方がない、と。数多の不幸の中にあってもなお、祝うべきことがひとつある。イフリートが討たれたこと、そしてそれを成し遂げたのがほかでもない、あなただという事実だ。これは並の者にできることではない。サンクレッドは、元よりあなたを平凡な存在だなどと思ったことはなく、むしろこの世界の行く末を左右しうる力を秘めていると感じていたと打ち明け、その見立てが間違っていなかったことを嬉しそうに語る。今回の功績をミンフィリアに伝える役目は自分に任せてほしい、と軽く笑いながら申し出るのは、せめてもの「自分なりの貢献」を主張したいからだろう。あなたはあなたで、しばしの休息を得る権利がある。十分に休んだら石の家に戻り、詳細を話し合おう──そう言い残し、彼はあなたを送り出すのだった。</p>
      <p>やがて「砂の家」に戻ったあなたは、入口でひとりの暁の仲間から歓迎を受ける。蛮神イフリートを討ち果たした英雄の帰還だと称えられ、サンクレッドがすでに先回りしてミンフィリアに報告をしていると知らされる。彼は現在、執務室で一連の経緯を詳しく説明しており、ミンフィリアもあなたに会えるのを心待ちにしているという。あなたが執務室の戸口に立つと、ちょうどサンクレッドが自らの不甲斐なさを打ち明けているところだった。彼は、アマルジャ族があなたを捕らえたとき、そしてあなたがイフリートの前に差し出されたとき、その場に居合わせなかったことを悔いる。あなたは奇跡的に生還したものの、本来ならばそんな危険をひとりで背負わせるべきではなかったと語り、自分はあなたにも暁にも応えられなかったと自責の念をにじませる。ミンフィリアは「終わってしまったことを責めても意味はない」と慰めようとするが、その途中であなたの姿に気づき、嬉しそうに歩み寄ってくる。無事に戻ってきてくれたことに心からの喜びを示し、サンクレッドは、ちょうど今しがたあなたの武勇伝を語り終えたところだと軽口を交えて場の空気を和らげる。そして、長く続いた調査がようやく一つの結論に到達したと説明する──当初の予想どおり、アマルジャ族はクリスタルの強奪と人さらいを、蛮神イフリート召喚のために行っていたのだ。こうした事件はウルダハ周辺に限られた話ではなく、最近はリムサ・ロミンサやグリダニア周辺でも同様の事案が頻発していることも明かされる。</p>
      <p>あなたの胸に浮かぶ疑問を察したのか、サンクレッドは蛮神についてさらに詳しく語り出す。蛮神が現世に顕現すると、その存在を維持するためにエーテルを消費し続けなければならない。そして力が強まれば強まるほど、必要とするエーテルの量も増えていく。エーテルはあらゆるものの中に存在し、すべての生命を流れ、あなたが吸う空気にさえ満ちている。しかし、そのように希薄なエーテルだけではイフリートのような存在を養うには足りず、蛮神たちはより高密度のエーテル源──すなわちクリスタルを渇望する。だからこそ、クリスタルを巡る事件の多くは蛮神へと行き着くのだとミンフィリアが補足する。では、人さらいの目的は何か。その答えは、蛮神の「生まれ方」と深く結びついている。世界が安定し、秩序が保たれているとき、蛮神は形ある存在としては現れず、その本質は大いなるエーテルの奔流の中に散り散りになっている。しかし、世が乱れ、蛮神を崇める者たちが苦しみからの救いを求めて必死に祈りを捧げると、その叫びは灯台の光のように蛮神の本質を呼び寄せる。その結果、散っていたエーテルが一点に集まり、肉体を伴う存在として形をなす。この現象を、暁の者たちは「エーテル凝集」と呼んでいる。一度この世に生を受けた蛮神は、崇拝によって力を得る。信徒の数が多く、信仰が熱ければ熱いほど、その神はより強大になっていくのだ。</p>
      <p>しかし、蛮神は信徒が自発的に捧げる信仰だけでは満足せず、さらに力を得るために、自ら信徒を生み出すことすら厭わない。その手段こそが「テンパード化」であり、今回あなた自身もその渦中に身を置くことになった。イフリートは、あなたの仲間や共に囚われていた不滅隊員たちの心を炎で焼き尽くし、自らの信徒へと変えようとしたが、あなたひとりだけはその支配を退けることができた。ミンフィリアは、その理由があなたの持つ「エコー」の力にあると説明する。なぜそうなるのかはまだ完全には解明されていないものの、エコーの加護を受けた者は蛮神の影響を受けず、まるでそれよりも大きな力に守られているかのように、テンパードを免れるのだという。かつて彼女は、蛮神問題に立ち向かうにあたってエコーが重要な役割を果たすだろうとあなたに語っていたが、今回の出来事を経た今なら、その意味がよく分かるだろう。サンクレッドは、最近起きた一連の事件に共通しているのは、いずれも綿密な計画に基づいているという点だと指摘する。これほど手の込んだ動きは、これまでの蛮神事件には見られなかった新たな傾向であり、彼に拭い難い不安を抱かせているのだ。ミンフィリアもその懸念を共有しつつ、それ以上に、あなたが無事に戻ってきたことへの安堵の思いが強いのだと正直に打ち明ける。</p>
      <p>ミンフィリアは、不滅隊が今回の件の後始末を引き受けてくれたため、あなたが細かな処理について心を煩わせる必要はないと伝える。しばしのあいだだけでも、胸をなで下ろしてよいだろうと。そして、このひとときの休息を存分に活かしてほしいと勧めつつも、イフリートを討ち果たした英雄の名が広まれば、きっとすぐに周囲からの期待や要請に追われ、ゆっくり休む暇もなくなるだろうと、少し冗談めかして警告する。その後、部屋をあとにしたあなたのもとへ、サンクレッドが別れの挨拶にやって来る。ミンフィリアが意図的かどうかはさておき、あなたに伝え損ねていることがひとつあると切り出し、それは自分の口から話したほうがよいだろうと続ける。イフリートのもとから救い出されたテンパード状態の人々──あなたとともに囚われていた不滅隊員も含め、全員が処刑されることになったのだという。この決定は一般には決して明かされてはならない極秘事項であり、世間には知られてはならない。彼は、もし他に手段があるのなら決してこんな選択はしないのだと誓いながらも、一度テンパードとなった者は生涯その状態から逃れられず、存在しているだけで崇拝対象の蛮神に力を与え続けてしまうのだと説明する。その生命が続くかぎり、彼らは神にとって都合のよい「力の供給源」であり続けてしまうのである。だからこそ、暁はこれ以上無辜の者が犠牲にならなくて済むよう戦い続けているのだと述べ、あなたにもどうか今後も共に歩んでほしいと願いを託す。そして、不滅隊が被った損害について炎獄軍団長に詫びを入れねばならないと告げ、サンクレッドはその場を去っていく。残された彼の胸中には、いったいあとどれほど多くの命が失われるのかという問いと、「ルイゾワなら決してこのような事態を許さなかっただろう」という悔恨が渦巻いている。自分はもっとよくやらなければならない、もっと強くあらねばならない──そう固く心に誓いながら、彼は次なる戦いへ向けて歩みを進めるのだった。</p>

      <p>在 The Waking Sands 的 The Solar 裡，Minfilia 再次把你叫到身邊。她說，剛收到 Thancred 傳回的最新消息，關於先前在 Thanalan 展開的調查有了新的進展。他從假 priest Ungust 那裡再度挖出了重要情報──Ungust 即將與 Amalj’aa 見面，討論雙方之間的交易內容。Immortal Flames 判斷，這場秘密會面正是抓住綁架犯背後主使的最佳機會，因此決定讓 Ungust 按計畫出席會談，再趁 Amalj’aa 昏然不覺之際埋伏出擊。不過，Amalj’aa 絕不會坐以待斃，勢必會激烈反抗，因此 Flames 也向 Scions of the Seventh Dawn 發出支援請求。Minfilia 希望在 Thancred 暫時分身乏術的這段時間，由你代表 Scions 前往協助，成為這次行動中唯一駐紮現場的成員。出發前，她轉達了 Thancred 的一句玩笑話──要你「記得留點對手給他」，那是他對你實力的信心，而她也抱持著完全相同的信任。等你準備完成，就前往 Camp Drybone，向負責本次任務的 flame sergeant 報到。她最後送上熟悉的祝福，願你行於水晶之光之中。</p>
      <p>在 Camp Drybone，flame sergeant 立刻上前迎接你，確認你就是來自 Scions 的那位冒險者，並由衷感謝你前來支援。他毫不掩飾你加入後戰力大增的事實，接著向你說明整個作戰計畫：這次的目標，是活捉 Amalj’aa 戰士，從他們口中逼問被綁架者的下落。Amalj’aa 仍相信 Ungust 是忠誠的線人，完全不知道他已經遭到揭露，因此當他們照約定前來與這名 traitor 見面時，Flames 就要在約定地點設下陷阱，一舉包抄。由於行動性質極為機密，無法出動大規模兵力，所以每一個成員都至關重要，這也是他們必須請求 Scions 協助的原因。會面會在一處名為 Invisible City 的古老遺跡附近舉行，你必須先行前往，潛伏等待。抵達現場後，sergeant 先確認「餌」是否就位，私兵回報負責演出的那名人員已經到達指定位置。只要 Amalj’aa 一現身，就準備行動──然而，就在此時，情勢突然出現不祥的轉折。Ungust 突然怪笑出聲，緊接著，一名身穿 Flames 制服的士兵轉身對準同伴，發出同樣瘋狂的笑聲。內奸在此刻露出真面目，高聲宣告這場埋伏到此為止。Ungust 得意洋洋地說，自己之所以能一次又一次逃過 Immortal Flames 的追捕，是因為一直有人從內部向他通風報信，而叛徒也大笑著承認，是他讓 Ungust 事先得知每一次的行動。也就是說，你們的每一步，都早已被掌握在敵人手中。隨後，他們以近乎戲謔的口氣，將你們一行人「完好無缺地」交給 Amalj’aa，自顧自退到一旁。你只能拔劍迎戰，與蜂擁而上的 lizardmen 展開血戰。</p>
      <p>雖然你擊倒了第一波衝上前來的 Amalj’aa 戰士，但後續局勢很快失控。在混亂之中，那名叛變的 Flame soldier 扯住一名同伴，把武器架在對方頸上，威脅你放下武器，否則就當場殺人。即使有士兵試圖在你身後提醒，也無法扭轉劣勢。Ungust 命人把你們聚到一起，叛徒則下令所有俘虜立刻啟程。手無寸鐵的你與僅存的 Flames 被長槍押送，往南方荒漠一路行軍。最後，你們被帶進 Amalj’aa 的根據地 Zanr’ak，在粗糙石牆與祭壇環繞的陰影下，被關押在一起。一名 captured Flame private 完全崩潰，一邊哭泣一邊說自己肯定會被殺，只想回家再也不想面對這種恐懼。另一名士兵則顫抖著表示，Amalj’aa 把你們押到這座 stronghold 之後，似乎正在準備某件事情，他不願想像自己會在那件事完成時還活著。Flame sergeant 緊咬牙關，認為 Amalj’aa 很可能要把你們獻祭給他們的 god，如果必須死，他也希望至少能以戰士的身分、手握武器倒下。他咒罵 Flames 居然出了 traitor，對組織如今的處境感到悲憤，最後還是轉頭向你道歉，說如果自己看人有準，你也不會被拖進這一團混亂之中。</p>
      <p>接下來在 Zanr’ak 發生的事──Amalj’aa 完成召喚，Ifrit 降臨，你被迫站在 Lord of the Inferno 面前，與他在烈焰中對峙，並在理應不可能存活的試煉中奇蹟般地活了下來──這一切都在你心底留下深刻的烙印。待你終於再度回到 Camp Drybone、帶著滿身火焰與砂礫的氣息時，Thancred 正在那裡等你。他先請你趁現在好好休息，因為在親眼目睹自己的 god 慘敗之後，Amalj’aa 至少在一段時間內會比較不敢輕易招惹 Scions 的怒火。接著，他鄭重向你道歉，坦言自己來得太遲──既沒趕上你被抓走的那一刻，也無法阻止你被當作供物送上 Ifrit 面前。與你一同被綁走的人，肉體雖然還活著，心卻已經不再完整；因為一旦被 tempered，就再也無法回頭。話說到一半，他停了下來，不願再繼續沉浸在這種陰鬱的想法中。他說自己不應該只看見壞的一面，畢竟在這麼多不幸之中，還是有值得慶賀的重要成果──Ifrit 已經被討伐，而親手完成這件事的人，就是你。這種戰果絕非尋常之輩能辦到。他坦承自己從來不覺得你是「普通人」，相反地，他一直認為你擁有左右這個世界未來的潛力，而這次勝利只是再度印證了他的眼光。Thancred 希望由自己向 Minfilia 報告這一切，好讓他至少能在紀錄上留下一點「貢獻」。至於你，已經再沒有任何人能否認你應得的休息。他叮囑你先好好放鬆，等自己覺得準備好了，再回到 The Waking Sands，屆時再詳細討論後續。只不過，他也不忘提醒你，這個世界的問題可不會自己消失。</p>
      <p>回到 The Waking Sands 時，一名 Scion of the Seventh Dawn 成員在門口迎接你，稱你為凱旋歸來的英雄。Thancred 比你早一步抵達，已經把 Ifrit 被討伐的消息帶來，現在正在 The Solar 裡向 Minfilia 做詳細報告。對方說，Minfilia 一直在等你，希望你儘快進去。你推門進入時，正好聽到 Thancred 在向領袖坦白自己的失職：當 Amalj’aa 把你抓走、把你獻給 Ifrit 時，他都不在場。他說，即便你奇蹟似地活了下來，也無法抹去一個事實──你原本不應該孤身面對這種危險，他卻讓你獨自承受，這一點讓他覺得自己辜負了你，也辜負了 Scions。Minfilia 試圖安慰他，說已經發生的事再怎麼自責也無法挽回，但話還沒說完，就注意到你站在門口，立刻露出真心的笑容迎上前來，高興地表示能再次見到你平安歸來真是太好了。Thancred 則半開玩笑地說，自己才剛把你的英勇事蹟講給 Minfilia 聽完。兩人接著向你說明，這場曠日費時的調查終於有了清楚的結論：正如一開始所懷疑的那樣，Amalj’aa 搶奪 crystals、綁架民眾，全都是為了召喚他們的 primal──Ifrit。而且，這類事件並不限於 Ul’dah 周邊，最近在 Limsa Lominsa 和 Gridania 附近也屢見不鮮。</p>
      <p>看出你心中還有疑惑，Thancred 決定更詳盡地解釋關於 primals 的原理。他說，當 primal 在物質世界顯現後，必須不斷攝取 aether，才能維持存在，而力量越強，就需要越多的 aether。aether 遍布萬物，流動於所有生命之中，也充斥在你呼吸的空氣裡。然而，這些稀薄分散的 aether，仍不足以支撐 Ifrit 那樣的存在，因此 primals 渴求更高濃度的 aether 來源──也就是 crystals。Minfilia 補充說，正因如此，只要牽涉到 crystals 的事件，往往追查到最後都會指向某個 primal。至於綁架行動的目的，則與 primal 的誕生方式有關。當世界尚且安穩、秩序未被撼動時，primal 並沒有固定形體，它們的本質散布在龐大的 aether 流之中。但一旦世道陷入混亂，崇拜 primal 的信徒們在苦難之中向自己的 god 竭力呼求救贖，那些呼喚便會形成一道明確的燈塔。primal 的本質被這道「信仰的燈光」吸引，逐漸凝聚，最終形成具備肉體的存在──Scions 稱這個過程為「aetheric coalescence」。完成降臨之後，primal 便以信徒的 worship 為食，信徒越多、信仰越狂熱，god 自身就越強大。</p>
      <p>然而，primal 往往不滿足於信徒自願奉上的崇拜，為了獲得更多力量，它們甚至會親自製造新的信徒。這就是所謂的「tempering」，而你這次不幸親身經歷了這個過程。Ifrit 把你與 Flames 的戰友、其他被綁走的民眾一起拉到面前，試圖用火焰與威壓摧毀他們的意志，讓每一個人都成為自己的信徒。即便如此，你卻是唯一沒有被奪去自我的那個人。Minfilia 解釋，這是因為你擁有一種名為 the Echo 的力量。Scions 至今仍無法完全理解它的來源，但可以確定的是，擁有 Echo 的人對 primal 的影響免疫，就像被某種更高層次的力量保護著，不會被強迫改變信仰。當初你第一次造訪 Scions 時，她曾說過 Echo 對應付 primals 的威脅十分關鍵，如今在你親自經歷 Ifrit 的「洗禮」之後，這句話的含意便更加清晰。Thancred 接著指出，最近這些事件有一個共同特徵──每一件都經過縝密的計畫與佈局，遠比以往粗放的襲擊更為精密。這種新出現的模式讓他感到不祥的預感，難以擺脫。Minfilia 同樣憂慮，但此刻壓過一切的情緒，仍然是對你平安歸來的欣慰。</p>
      <p>Minfilia 告訴你，Immortal Flames 已經承諾會處理整起事件的後續，你不必為細節操心。至少在短暫的一段時間內，你可以稍微放心喘口氣。她建議你好好把握這段空檔，徹底休息一下，同時也提醒你，一旦人們知道是誰親手擊倒了 Ifrit，你恐怕很難再擁有這樣的清閒。你離開後，Thancred 再次來到你身邊。他說，Minfilia 無論是出於考量還是單純遺漏，有件事沒有對你提起，而他認為這件事應該由自己來說。那就是：從 Ifrit 手中被救出、已經被 tempered 的 abductees，包括跟你一起被囚禁的那些 Flames，全都將被處死。這項決定絕不能對外公開，一旦傳出去，後果不堪設想。他向你發誓，如果有任何其他可行的辦法，Scions 絕不會選擇這條路，但現實是，一旦一個人被 tempered，這種狀態就會持續一生。他的存在本身就成了某個 primal 的力量來源，不由自主地持續為那個 god 增添能量。正因如此，Scions 才必須持續戰鬥，盡可能避免再有更多無辜者陷入這樣的命運。他希望你仍願意與他們並肩作戰。說完這些，他表示自己必須去向 Flame General 為此次行動造成的損失致歉，暫時與你告別。離去之際，他在心裡默默自問，未來還要犧牲多少性命，才能終結這一切，又在心中浮現 Louisoix 的身影，覺得如果換成那位長者，絕對不會讓事態演變到這個地步。於是，他只能把這份悔意化為決心──必須做得更好，必須變得更強，才能對得起那些已經失去的一切，也才能繼續站在你們身旁。</p>
