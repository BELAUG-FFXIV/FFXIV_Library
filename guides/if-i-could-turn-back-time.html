<p>After the long war at last came to an end, Cyr still could not fathom why anyone would want to slay Hraesvelgr, and the thought left him visibly shaken. Yet even amid his confusion, there was one small comfort: they had at least found Inspector Hildibrand alive and in one piece, prompting a relieved comment from Nashu and a wistful aside from Godbert about his own trials as a father. Julyan eyed her son up and down, unconvinced that he was truly “all right,” but before she could press the issue, Hildibrand struck a pose and appealed to everyone present: he, agent of enquiry and inspector extraordinaire, begged their aid in rescuing his son and thwarting the Grand Sers’ mad plot. Cyr gently pointed out that such theatrics were unnecessary—they had come because they wanted to help. Nashu, in turn, answered with a flourish of her own, presenting a fresh set of clothes for the inspector’s grand return to form. Delighted, Hildibrand declared that he would change on the way, and together you all set off for Zenith in the Churning Mists, where Nashu cheered the return of his “classic inspector” look, Cyr marveled that he now stood in the very heart of Dravanian territory instead of hunting heretics in the streets, and Julyan fretted about the effect of this high altitude on her skin while Godbert admired the ancient stonework. At the summit, Hildibrand rallied his companions for the final battle with the Grand Sers—only to suddenly clutch at his side, realizing that his wounds were far worse than he had allowed himself to admit, and that he could not face the coming fight without something to restore him to his usual indomitable state.</p>
<p>Julyan immediately offered her trusty bottle of salamander oil and cheerfully volunteered to massage her “baby boy” back to health, but Hildibrand, flustered, hastily redirected the honor to you, insisting that he would not impose on his mother when his ever-loyal associate stood ready. Julyan teased him for his embarrassment, while Godbert calmly vouched for your “strong-yet-tender fingers,” declaring that he could personally attest to their miraculous effects. In the end, Julyan relented and entrusted her son to your care, and Hildibrand, with typical enthusiasm, urged you to waste no time in coating him in oil as you had “many a time before.” Nashu watched enviously, lamenting that she wished she could be the one to tend to the inspector, while Cyr, resigned, told you to simply get on with it. As you worked the salamander oil into Hildibrand’s battered muscles, Julyan nostalgically recalled past massages, and Godbert noted that such treatments were, in fact, a treasured Manderville tradition—one he hoped to pass on to little Gigi someday. Under your hands Hildibrand groaned and exclaimed as the warmth spread through his body: the aches and pains faded, the fires of righteousness flared anew in his breast, and though your enthusiasm briefly drove you to knead a little too fiercely, he quickly assured you that you had done right.</p>
<p>Sensing his son’s renewed spirit, Godbert stepped forward and declared that there was still room for Hildibrand to reach even greater heights of Mandervillian strength. Producing a vial of oil “derived from the purest essence of salamanders,” the ancient legacy of House Manderville itself, he solemnly presented Salamanderville to his beloved boy, now a proud father in his own right. Hildibrand gasped at the revelation, wondering if the legends were truly real, and Godbert confirmed that this sacred oil would make his muscles shine with the brilliance of a thousand suns, rendering him all but impervious to mortal harm—just as it had once allowed Godbert to endure the assaults of a bandit horde and bring his hammer of justice down upon them. With a flourish, he entrusted the vial to you and bade you help Hildibrand become the Manderville man he was always meant to be, while Nashu shielded her eyes, fearing the inspector might already be too shiny to behold. Bracing himself, Hildibrand declared that he was ready for his “final oiling,” and when Salamanderville touched his skin he cried out in astonishment as it flowed into every nook and cranny of his body. Under your hands his exclamations rose into wild shouts as heat and power surged within him, his passion blazing like an unbound inferno and a tempest unleashed. At the height of this transformation he roared his name and heritage to the heavens, proclaiming himself a true Manderville man, reborn. Breathless, Hildibrand marveled at the vivid colors, sharpened sounds, and even intensified scents that now surrounded him, and then turned to his parents and to you with newfound conviction, declaring that it was your oils and your strong-yet-tender fingers that had opened his eyes to the glory of creation. As a gentleman inspector reborn, he vowed that no perversion of nature nor broken limit could stop him, and he led the charge toward Zenith and to Gigi.</p>
<p>At the dragon’s roost, Hildibrand confronted the Grand Sers with a ringing declaration: he had come for his son. Dorys, unimpressed, complained that they had chosen a terrible time to interfere—they were on the verge of slaying a dragon, after all. Cyr stepped forward and insisted there was no reason for any of this; the war was over. Dorys scoffed at the notion of peace, explaining that the wyrm’s death would usher in a new era of fire and blood, and that by consuming his eyes the Grand Sers would gain power enough to win endless glory on the battlefield and carve their legends into eternity. Horrified, Cyr declared that he would not allow them to condemn countless innocents for the sake of their own renown, even if it cost him his life. Orland responded with cold finality, remarking that it would be no trouble to grant his wish, and as the Grand Sers prepared to unleash their “ultimate end,” even the staging around them seemed to promise a fatal clash.</p>
<p>Before that confrontation could reach its conclusion, however, Hildibrand turned his attention to the small figure at the heart of it all. He called softly to Gigi, asking his “beautiful boy” not to look at him with such pointy, accusing eyes, and begged to take him home to their beloved gazebo. The reply came in a distorted voice: the child rejected the name Gigi and screamed that he was Vivi, that he remembered everything—his powers, his purpose, and his Grandpapa Quan. He confessed that he had made the Grand Sers young again, but that it was not enough; he needed more, needed the wyrm’s eyes to finally bring Quan back. Hildibrand gently told him that he could not, because Grandpapa Quan was gone, and Cyr added that even if Vivi were somehow able to restore Quan’s body and move it with borrowed life, the man’s soul—what had truly made him Grandpapa—was forever beyond reach. Vivi refused to believe them, insisting that he could restore anything to its ideal form, to the way it “should” be, including Quan and even Hildibrand himself. Cyr, alarmed by the strain in his voice, begged him to stop, warning that if he continued to use his power this way it would cost him his own life.</p>
<p>Drawing on the research notes he had found, Cyr quietly explained what Archmagus Quan had discovered about Vivi’s abilities. The child had not been given the power to make things as they once were, but rather the power to change the world into what he believed things ought to be. That, Cyr said, was why Vivi’s magicks had no effect on Hildibrand: deep down, Vivi knew that the inspector’s battered, bruised, and ever-enthusiastic state was, in its own way, exactly right. Hildibrand agreed wholeheartedly and added that the same truth explained why Vivi had been unable to make Quan young again. In Vivi’s heart, there had never been anything wrong with his grandpapa; he had always been exactly as he should be, and every day spent together had been something to treasure. By contrast, all Vivi truly knew of the Grand Sers were the stories they told of their own youth—tales of daring heroes in their prime—and it was no wonder that he could so easily imagine and thus restore them to that state. In the beginning, Cyr continued, Quan himself had misunderstood this power, wondering why Vivi could not reshape him as intended. Eventually, however, the archmagus realized that Vivi’s fond memories would never allow him to conceive of Quan as anything but the elderly creator he loved, and that the only way to achieve his original goal would be to strip those memories away.</p>
<p>Faced with that choice, Quan had done the opposite. To him, Vivi was no longer a mere mammet, but family—his only family—his grandson. He could not bear to lose the bond they shared, and so he abandoned his quest for immortality. Vivi protested that he had lost his memories anyway, but Cyr explained that this too had been an act of protection. Near the end of his life, fearful that others might attempt to exploit Vivi and his power once he was gone, Quan decided to seal away the boy’s memories so that he would not be left alone and vulnerable in a hostile world. Yet even then, something remained—something stronger and more enduring than Quan had ever imagined. Vivi had never truly been broken or cast aside; what Quan had wanted, Cyr said, was to set him free. Confused, Vivi asked what “free” was supposed to mean and what he was meant to do with such freedom. Hildibrand answered with gentle conviction that Vivi could do whatever he liked, that this was his final gift from Quan: a new life and a new story all his own, no longer bound by another’s wish for eternal youth.</p>
<p>Dorys, impatient with the heartfelt exchange, cut in with a biting remark that they were all getting older by the moment and that she had tolerated enough meddling. She revealed a trap meant to kill the wyrm and, seeing her foes conveniently gathered, decided to use it on them instead. At that crucial instant, Vivi straightened and shouted his full name to the world—grandson of Archmagus Quan and son of Hildibrand Helidor Maximilian Manderville—and declared that this was his story. Then he unleashed his power one final time. Light flared, time twisted, and when the radiance faded it was as if the disaster had never occurred: the pillars stood whole, the battlefield intact, and everyone present had been restored to their former condition. Cyr could only stare and murmur that Vivi had turned back the hands of time, not just for the stone but for all of them, making them as they once were—indeed, as they were meant to be. Julyan, looking herself over, fumed that after all of that she had gained nothing at all, lamenting the loss of her “misspent youth,” while Godbert laughed in delight, boasting that never had his squats felt more perfect and that he might have reached his physical peak. Dorys scoffed at his antics and told him to act his age, but Cyr calmly reminded her that Vivi had given them a second chance after seeing what they had become.</p>
<p>Dorys answered that reliving their glory days was their second chance, clinging to the past even as Orland quietly reflected that perhaps Quan had been right, and that growing old might not be so terrible after all. Gonspart, emboldened by age instead of cowed by it, confessed that he had been a coward in his youth, but that now he was unafraid to say aloud that he loved Dorys. She called him a blind, bloody fool, but the words carried less venom than before. In the wake of these revelations, Hildibrand stirred and wondered aloud if he had died yet again, only for Cyr to assure him that he was very much alive, as was everyone else, thanks to Gigi—Vivi—and that the Grand Sers were now safely in custody. Laughing proudly, Hildibrand immediately asked after his boy, but Cyr hesitated and explained that Gigi had embarked on a grand new adventure and was no longer with them. The inspector fell silent, then quietly accepted the news, saying that if this was what Gigi had wanted, he could not be happier for him and was certain that Archmagus Quan would feel the same. When Nashu timidly asked what they should do now, Hildibrand’s eyes lit up once more: the wide, wide world still called to them with mysteries and wonders, he said, and they would simply resume their never-ending quest for perplexing and profound cases—perhaps, someday, crossing paths with young Gigi again.</p>
<p>Julyan admitted with a sigh that the whole affair had left her thinking that maybe it wouldn’t be so bad to have a grandson after all, and she told Hildibrand that he had done right by Gigi; she and Godbert were proud of the man he had become. In response, Hildibrand, ever earnest, declared that he was proud of her too for accepting the fleeting nature of physical beauty and allowing herself to age gracefully. The word “gracefully” struck a nerve, and moments later a Manderville-style blow launched him skyward once more. As he sailed away, Nashu cried out and chased after him, calling for him to wait. High above, Hildibrand caught sight of a curious light in the far eastern sky and sniffed the air, sensing a familiar scent that could only mean one thing: a new case. Calling back to his friends below, he bade them not to worry and proclaimed that wherever the wronged wanted for succor, he, Hildibrand, would be there—until they met again. Back on the ground, Godbert turned to Julyan and casually pointed out that as long as Gigi’s core remained intact the boy was not truly dead. Julyan agreed and urged their “moping” son to dry his tears; there was no need to grieve as if all were lost. Godbert explained that Gigi had simply exhausted his aether and fallen into a dormant state, and that, in time, his core would slowly recharge by drawing on the ambient aether until he awakened from his torpor. Until then, Godbert would look after the child.</p>
<p>Godbert also offered to escort the Grand Sers back to Ishgard, but Cyr, ever dutiful, initially insisted that it was his responsibility to bring them to justice—only to falter as he remembered the harsh words he had spoken to a younger inquisitor. After all that had happened, he could no longer return to Ishgard as if nothing had changed; branded a heretic, he would likely be thrown into a gaol for life, if not killed outright. Julyan cut through his despair with characteristic bluntness, suggesting that he move to Idyllshire and live in Hildibrand’s gazebo instead. Someone had to look after it while the inspector was away, she reasoned. The thought gave Cyr pause, but the more he considered it, the more appealing it sounded, and he gladly accepted the offer. As Hildibrand continued to hang stubbornly in the sky, Julyan sighed that there was nothing for it but to wait until he came back down, while Godbert praised her latest “graceful” strike, assuring her that she had not lost her touch.</p>
<p>Later, in Idyllshire, Cyr stood before you and reflected on the path that had led him there. Looking back on his former life, he could not help but feel ashamed of the man he had been—an inquisitor who had barely left the capital, clinging to rigid “facts” and unquestioned dogma. Meeting you, Hildibrand, and Gigi had made him realize how much he had come to loathe that role, and how much more fulfilling it was to pursue the whole truth rather than convenient certainties. Being branded a heretic and forced to flee Ishgard, he admitted with a wry smile, might have been the best thing that ever happened to him, for it freed him to begin anew in Idyllshire as a consulting inspector instead. Then, setting aside his musings, he introduced someone he wanted you to meet. Godbert had modified Gigi’s form, making him smaller so that he could absorb aether more efficiently over time, and they had agreed that if he were to travel at your side and share in your grand adventures, it might hasten his reawakening. With quiet gratitude, Cyr thanked you for everything you had done and expressed the hope that your paths would cross again someday, sending you off with the Fury’s blessing as your journey with your new, slumbering companion began.</p>

<p>千年もの戦いにようやく終止符が打たれたというのに、なぜ今さらフレースヴェルグを殺そうとするのか──Cyr はその理屈がどうしても理解できず、戸惑いを隠せなかった。それでも、少なくともヒルディブランドを無事に見つけ出せたという事実には、わずかな安堵を覚える。ナシュは再会を喜び、ゴッドベルトは父として歩んできた数々の試練の日々を思い返してしみじみとつぶやいた。ジュリアンは息子の様子をじっと観察し、「見た目は元気そうだが本当に大丈夫かいね」と訝しむが、問い詰めるより先に、ヒルディブランドがいつもの決めポーズで皆の前に躍り出る。自らを「謎を追う紳士探偵」と名乗り、息子を救い出しグランドサーズの企みを阻止するため、力を貸してほしいと高らかに宣言するのだ。だが Cyr は、そんな大げさな口上は不要だと穏やかに諭す。自分たちは最初から助けたいと思ってここに来たのだと。すると今度はナシュが意気揚々と、検事用の新しい衣装を取り出してみせる。ヒルディブランドは大喜びでそれを受け取り、「着替えは道中で済ませよう！」と言い放ち、一行はドラヴァニア雲海のゼニスを目指して旅立つ。やがて現地に到着すると、ナシュはやはり「いつもの検事スタイルが一番！」と目を輝かせ、Cyr はかつて異端者狩りに明け暮れていた自分が、今やドラヴァニアの中心に立っていることに不思議な感慨を覚える。ジュリアンは高地の空気が肌に悪いとぼやき、ゴッドベルトは古の工芸品のような石造りに感嘆の声を漏らした。そして山頂でヒルディブランドは仲間たちを鼓舞し、「いよいよグランドサーズとの最終決戦だ！」と宣言する……が、その直後、急に脇腹を押さえて顔を歪める。思っていた以上に傷が深く、このままでは敵と相対することができない。いつもの不屈の状態を取り戻すために、何かが必要だと悟るのだった。</p>
<p>すかさずジュリアンが、愛用のサラマンダーオイルを取り出し、「ママがマッサージしてあげようかね」と息子を癒やす気満々で名乗りを上げる。しかしヒルディブランドは狼狽し、「母上に甘えるわけにはいかぬ」と慌てて話題をそらし、代わりにいつも共にある相棒──つまりあなたに施術を頼みたいと主張する。ジュリアンは息子の照れ隠しをからかい、ゴッドベルトは落ち着いた口調で、あなたの「強く、しかし優しい指先」の癒やしの力を自らの体験をもって証言する。最終的にジュリアンも折れ、ヒルディブランドは大げさな身振りで「さあ遅れを取ってはならぬ、いつものように全身くまなくオイルを塗ってくれたまえ！」とあなたに促す。ナシュはうらやましそうにその様子を見つめ、「いつかは自分もオイルを塗ってあげたい」と小さく嘆息し、Cyr は半ばあきらめ顔で「さっさと済ませてくれ」と背中を押す。あなたがサラマンダーオイルをヒルディブランドの傷ついた筋肉に丁寧に塗り込み、指先で揉みほぐしていくと、ジュリアンは懐かしそうに昔のマッサージを思い出し、ゴッドベルトはこれこそマンデヴィル家に受け継がれる伝統だと語る。やがてヒルディブランドの口からはうめきとも感嘆ともつかぬ声が漏れ、温かな熱が全身に広がっていく。痛みは和らぎ、胸の内には再び「正義の炎」が燃え上がる。あなたが勢い余って少々強く揉みすぎた瞬間もあったが、彼はすぐに「いや、これでよかったのだ」と笑い、施術の効果を全身で受け止めるのだった。</p>
<p>息子の内に宿る新たな活力を感じ取ったゴッドベルトは、さらにその力を一段と高めるべく、一歩前に進み出る。そして、サラマンダーの純粋な精髄から抽出された、マンデヴィル家に伝わる秘伝のオイルを取り出した。「サラマンデヴィル」と名付けられたその聖油こそ、由緒正しき家の秘宝であると、ゴッドベルトは厳かに告げる。ヒルディブランドは、かねてより噂に聞いていた伝説のオイルが現実に目の前にあることに驚愕し、ゴッドベルトは続けて、その効能を語る。これを身にまとう者の筋肉は千の太陽のごとく輝き、凡百の者には傷一つ負わせることすら叶わない。かつて自らが盗賊団の攻撃に耐え抜き、正義のハンマーを振り下ろすことができたのも、このオイルの加護あってこそだと。そう言って彼はサラマンデヴィルをあなたに託し、「真のマンデヴィルとなるべく、息子に塗ってやってくれ」と頼む。ナシュは「これ以上輝いたら本当に目がつぶれちゃう！」と目を覆い、ヒルディブランドは深く息を吸い、「最後のオイルを受け入れる覚悟はできている」と宣言する。オイルが肌に触れた瞬間、彼は全身を駆け巡る熱に驚嘆の声を上げ、あなたの手がその力を全身へと行き渡らせていく。やがてその叫びは熱狂的な咆哮へと変わり、燃え盛る炎と解き放たれた嵐のごとき力が彼の中で渦を巻く。ついには天を仰いで己の名と血筋を高らかに叫び、真なる「マンデヴィルマン」として生まれ変わったことを宣言するのだった。息を切らしながら、ヒルディブランドは世界の色彩の鮮烈さ、音の鋭さ、そして香りの豊かさに驚き、両親とあなたを振り返る。そして、自分の目を開かせてくれたのは、このオイルと、強く優しいあなたの指先だと心から告げると、紳士探偵として新たに生まれ変わった自分には、もはや恐れるものはないと胸を張る。かくして彼は、自然の理をもねじ曲げる敵であろうと打ち倒すと誓い、仲間たちとともにゼニス、そしてギギのもとへと駆け出していく。</p>
<p>竜の棲むゼニスの地で、ヒルディブランドは堂々とグランドサーズの前に立ちはだかり、「息子を迎えに来た」と高らかに告げる。だがドリスは辟易したように肩をすくめ、今は竜を仕留める大事な場面なのだと不満をあらわにする。Cyr は一歩前に踏み出し、「もはや戦争は終わった、こんなことをする必要はない」と訴えるが、ドリスは鼻で笑い、その考えを一蹴する。彼女の目には、竜の死こそが新たな血と炎の時代の幕開けであり、竜の眼を喰らって得た力によって、彼らは戦場で比類なき栄光を手に入れ、名を永遠に刻むのだという未来しか見えていない。Cyr は無数の罪なき人々がその栄光のために犠牲になる現実に戦慄し、たとえ自分の命を賭してでも、この暴走を止めてみせると声を震わせながら宣言する。オルランドは冷ややかな笑みを浮かべ、「望みどおり、ここで終わらせてやろう」と告げ、グランドサーズは「究極の終焉」をもってすべてを葬り去ろうと構えを取る。周囲の空気さえも、いよいよ終局が訪れることを暗示していた。</p>
<p>しかし、その決戦が本当に始まる前に、ヒルディブランドは静かに視線を小さな存在へと移す。彼はギギに向かって優しく語りかけ、「そんなに尖った目で見ないでほしい」と、愛し子をあやすように声をかける。そして、「さあ、一緒にガゼボへ帰ろう」と手を差し伸べる。だが返ってきたのは、どこか歪んだ声だった。子どもはギギと呼ばれることを拒み、「自分の名はビビだ」と叫ぶ。自分の力も、目的も、祖父クアンのこともすべて思い出したのだと。彼は、自分がグランドサーズを若返らせたことを明かし、それだけでは足りないのだと訴える。竜の眼を手に入れなければ、クアンを完全に取り戻すことはできないのだ、と。ヒルディブランドは穏やかに、「クアンはもうこの世にはいない」と告げ、Cyr は続けて、たとえビビがクアンの肉体を再構成し、仮初の命を吹き込んだとしても、魂──彼を「祖父たらしめていたもの」は永遠に戻らないのだと諭す。ビビはそれを受け入れられず、「自分にはすべてを理想の姿に戻す力がある」と叫ぶ。物事をあるべき姿にできるのであれば、クアンも、パパ・ヒルディさえも元どおりにできるはずだと。Cyr はその声ににじむ焦りと負担を感じ取り、これ以上力を使えばビビ自身の命が危険にさらされると必死に制止する。</p>
<p>そこで Cyr は、クアンが残した研究記録をもとに、ビビの力の本質について静かに語り始める。与えられた力は、過去そのものを「元に戻す」ものではなく、ビビが「あるべき姿」だと信じる世界へと現実を書き換える力なのだと。だからこそ、その魔法はヒルディブランドには一切通じない。Cyr はそう説明し、ヒルディブランドも力強く相槌を打つ。ビビの心のどこかで、傷だらけで打たれ強く、毎日を全力で生きる彼の姿こそが、ある種「正しい」と認められているからだと。そして、この理屈はクアンを若返らせられなかった理由も説明している。ビビにとって祖父は、初めから「そうあるべき姿」のままに愛されていた。老いた創造者としての姿に何一つ欠けるところはなく、一緒に過ごした日々はすべて大切な宝物だったのだ。対照的に、ビビがグランドサーズを若返らせることができたのは、彼らについて知っていたものが、自ら語る若かりし日の武勇伝だけだったからだ。黄金期の英雄たちとしての姿を思い描くのは容易であり、そのイメージどおりに世界を書き換えてしまえたのだろう。Cyr は続けて、当初クアン自身もこの力を誤解していたことを明かす。なぜ自分だけが思いどおりに若返らないのか、その理由がわからず、彼は長く悩み続けた。しかしやがて、ビビの中にある温かな記憶こそが、自分を「それ以外の姿」として想像することを許さないのだと悟る。つまり、本来の目的を果たすには、その記憶を奪うしかないという結論に至ったのだ。</p>
<p>だが、そこでクアンが選んだのは、まったく逆の道だった。彼にとってビビは、もはやただの人形ではない。家族であり、唯一残された家族であり、愛すべき孫であった。だからこそ、その絆を犠牲にしてまで永遠の若さを求めることなどできなかった。クアンは不死への野望を捨てる道を選んだのである。ビビは「それなのに結局、記憶を失ってしまった」と反論するが、Cyr はそれもまた守るための選択だったのだと説明する。死を前にしたクアンは、ビビが一人きりになったとき、その力を狙って利用しようとする者が現れることを恐れた。だから最後に、彼はビビの記憶を封じる決断をする。孤独と悪意から守るために。しかし、その努力をもってしても消し去れなかったものがある。クアンの想像をはるかに超えるほど強く、しなやかで、しぶとい何かが。Cyr は、「ギギは壊れてもいないし、捨てられてもいない」と言い切る。クアンが望んだのは、ただ彼を自由にすることだったのだと。ビビは「自由」とは何なのか、何をすればいいのかと戸惑いの声を漏らすが、ヒルディブランドは優しく微笑みかける。自由とは、自分の好きなことを選べることだと。クアンが残した最後の贈り物は、新しい人生であり、自ら紡ぐ新たな物語なのだと。もはや誰かの望む永遠の若さのためではなく、ビビ自身のためだけに歩いてよいのだと、彼は静かに伝える。</p>
<p>だが感動の空気を、ドリスは露骨なまでの苛立ちで断ち切る。「しんみりしている暇はない」と言わんばかりに、彼女は自分たちが年を取っていく現実を持ち出し、これ以上の干渉はごめんだと吐き捨てる。そして、もともと竜を殺すために仕掛けておいた罠を明かし、ちょうど良い位置に立つ一行ごとまとめて葬り去ろうとする。その決定的な瞬間、ビビは胸を張って名を名乗る。大魔道士クアンの孫であり、ヒルディブランド・ヘリドール・マキシミリアン・マンデヴィルの息子であるビビこそが、この物語の主人公だと。そして、彼は最後の力を解き放つ。まばゆい光が世界を包み、時間はねじれ、流れを逆行する。やがて光が消えたとき、そこにあったのは破壊の痕跡なき景色だった。柱は元どおりに立ち並び、戦場も、そこにいる人々も、すべてがかつての姿に戻っている。Cyr は呆然としながら、「ビビは時間そのものを巻き戻したのだ」とつぶやく。柱だけではなく、自分たち自身までも。皆を、あるべき姿へと戻したのだと。ジュリアンは自分の体を確かめ、「あれだけ大騒ぎしたのに、あたしの若い頃は返ってこないのかい！」と怒りをあらわにし、ゴッドベルトは爽快そうに笑いながら、これまでになく完璧なフォームでスクワットができたと豪語し、自分は今まさに肉体の絶頂期かもしれないと胸を張る。ドリスはそんな彼を「いい年して何をやっている」とあしらうが、Cyr は静かに、「ビビは君たちの姿を見て、もう一度やり直す機会を与えたのだ」と諭すのだった。</p>
<p>ドリスは唇をかみしめ、「私たちにとって、若き日の栄光をやり直すことこそが第二のチャンスだった」と言い返す。しかしオルランドは、そんなやり直しもどこか滑稽に思えてきたと苦笑し、クアンの考えのほうが正しかったのかもしれない、歳を重ねるのも案外悪くないのかもしれないとつぶやく。ゴンスパールは、若い頃の自分がいかに臆病だったかを告白し、今の自分は「ドリスを愛している」と口に出すことを恐れないのだと言う。ドリスは「まったく、目の見えないバカね」と罵るが、その響きは以前よりずっと柔らかい。その一方で、ヒルディブランドはようやく目を覚まし、「また死んでしまったかと思った」とぼんやりつぶやく。しかし Cyr は、あなたと同じく彼も無事であり、皆がギギ──ビビのおかげで助かったのだと伝える。グランドサーズも拘束済みであると聞くと、ヒルディブランドは誇らしげに笑い、「さすが我が息子だ」と胸を張る。そして当然のように、すぐにギギの姿を探すのだが、Cyr は一瞬言葉に詰まり、やがて「ギギは大いなる冒険に旅立ち、もうここにはいない」と告げる。ヒルディブランドはしばし沈黙したのち、小さく「そうか」とつぶやく。そして、「それがギギ自身の望みであるなら、自分はこれ以上ないほど嬉しい」と言い、きっとクアンも同じように喜んでいるだろうと穏やかな笑みを浮かべる。ナシュが「これからどうするのか」とおずおず尋ねると、彼の瞳にはふたたび光が宿る。世界は広く、未だ見ぬ謎と驚きに満ちている。ならばやるべきことは一つ、永遠に続く難事件探しの旅を再開するまでだ。そしていつの日か、再び若きギギとどこかで巡り会えるかもしれない、と。</p>
<p>ジュリアンは大きくため息をつきながらも、心のどこかで「本当に孫がいても悪くないかもしれない」と思うようになった自分に気づく。そして、「ギギのためによくやった」とヒルディブランドに告げる。父親としてしっかり向き合った息子の姿を、彼女もゴッドベルトも誇りに思っていた。ヒルディブランドは、そんな母に向き直り、「母上もまた、移ろう肉体の美を受け入れ、優雅に年を重ねていることを誇りに思う」と真顔で言ってのける。その言葉の中の「優雅に」という一節が見事に地雷を踏み抜き、次の瞬間、マンデヴィル流の一撃が炸裂する。ヒルディブランドは空高く吹き飛ばされ、ナシュは「また飛ばされちゃいました！」と叫びながら、そのあとを必死に追いかける。空の上で彼は、遥か東の空に不思議な光を見つけ、鼻先をくすぐる懐かしい匂いを嗅ぎ取る。「あれは……事件の匂いだ！」と叫び、地上の仲間たちに向かって「自分のことは心配無用、理不尽に苦しむ者がいる限り、ヒルディブランドはどこにでも駆けつける」と声を張り上げ、「また会う日まで」と別れを告げる。その頃、地上ではゴッドベルトがふと思い出したようにジュリアンへと視線を向け、「ギギのコアさえ無事なら、彼は決して死んではいない」と告げる。ジュリアンもそれに同意し、「そんなに落ち込む必要はない」と息子に涙を拭くよう促す。ゴッドベルトは、ギギが力を使い果たして眠りについただけであり、周囲のエーテルを吸収しながらコアを少しずつ充電し、やがて長い眠りから目覚めるだろうと説明する。そして、その時が来るまで、自分が子どもの世話をすると静かに約束するのだった。</p>
<p>さらにゴッドベルトは、グランドサーズをイシュガルドまで連れ帰る役目を引き受けようと申し出る。しかし Cyr は、もともと彼らを裁きに連れて帰るのは自分の務めだったのだと主張し、一度はその責任を譲ろうとしない。だがすぐに、先ほど若き異端審問官に投げかけた言葉を思い出し、言葉を詰まらせる。これまでの経緯を思えば、もはや何事もなかったかのようにイシュガルドへ戻ることはできない。異端の烙印を押されたまま帰れば、牢に放り込まれ、一生出られないか、あるいはその場で処刑されるだろう。ジュリアンはそんな彼の苦悩をあっさり切り裂き、「それならアイデルシャイアに行って、ヒルディのガゼボに住めばいい」と提案する。留守の間、誰かが見張っておくべきだろうと。Cyr は一瞬ぽかんとしてしまうが、よくよく考えてみると悪くない話だと気づき、喜んでその提案を受け入れる。空の彼方に飛ばされたヒルディブランドを見上げながら、ジュリアンは「戻ってくるまで待つしかないね」と肩を落とし、ゴッドベルトは先ほどの一撃を「実に見事なストライクだった」と褒めたたえ、妻の腕はまだまだ衰えていないと微笑むのだった。</p>
<p>その後、アイデルシャイアで Cyr はあなたの前に立ち、自ら歩んできた道のりを振り返る。かつての自分を思い返すと、恥ずかしさで顔を上げられないと告白する。王都の外へ出たことはほとんどなく、疑うことを知らぬ「事実」だけを信じ、偏った教義に縛られていた日々。もしあなたと、ヒルディブランドと、ギギに出会わなければ、自分がどれほど今の仕事を嫌っていたかにも気づけなかっただろうし、「真実のすべて」を追い求めることがどれほど満ち足りた生き方かを知ることもなかっただろうと。異端の烙印を押され、イシュガルドから逃げ出さざるをえなくなったことさえ、今となっては最高の転機だったのかもしれない。おかげで今、自分はここアイデルシャイアで「コンサルティング・インスペクター」として、新たな人生を始めることができたのだから、と苦笑まじりに語る。やがて彼は話を切り上げ、「紹介したい相手がいる」と言って、あなたを奥へと案内する。そこには、ゴッドベルトが改造を施した小さなギギの姿があった。以前よりもずっと小さな姿に作り替えられたのは、より効率よくエーテルを吸収できるようにするためだという。そして Cyr は、もしこの子があなたと共に旅をし、数々の冒険を共にすることができれば、その覚醒も早まるかもしれないと考えたのだと語る。最後に彼は、これまであなたがしてくれたすべてに感謝を述べ、いつの日か再び道が交わることを願っていると告げる。そして、ハルオーネの加護があなたにあらんことをと祈りながら、眠れる小さな旅の仲間を託すのだった。</p>

<p>千年的戰爭好不容易才畫下句點，Cyr 卻仍無法理解，為什麼在這個時候還要去殺掉 Hraesvelgr。光是這個念頭，就讓他滿臉困惑與不安。不過即使如此，至少還有一件值得慶幸的事──他們總算找到活蹦亂跳的 Inspector Hildibrand。Nashu 開心地迎上前去，Godbert 則感慨地提起自己當父親時的種種磨練。Julyan 上上下下打量著兒子，雖然嘴上說「看起來沒問題」，眼神裡卻滿是懷疑。就在她準備再追問之前，Hildibrand 已經擺出熟悉的招牌姿勢，自稱「謎團調查的紳士探偵」，當眾宣告自己要救回兒子，並阻止 Grand Sers 的瘋狂計畫，希望大家能伸出援手。Cyr 卻溫和地指出，根本不需要這麼鋪張的開場白──他們會來，就是因為真心想幫忙。Nashu 緊接著以自己的方式回應，隆重地拿出一套全新的制服，要讓 Inspector 以「經典造型」回歸。Hildibrand 樂得合不攏嘴，當場表示自己會「路上換衣服」，於是一行人動身前往 Dravania 雲海的 Zenith。抵達高處後，Nashu 忍不住感嘆「果然還是原本的檢查官裝最好」，Cyr 則站在 Dravanian 領土的深處，回想起不久前自己還在街上追查所謂「異端者」，心情恍如隔世。Julyan 一邊抱怨高海拔對皮膚不好，一邊跟著眾人前進，Godbert 則對周圍彷彿工藝品般的石造建築讚嘆不已。在山頂上，Hildibrand 召集大家，宣布與 Grand Sers 的最終決戰即將到來──然而話說到一半，他突然捂住側腹，露出痛苦的表情，這才意識到自己的傷勢比想像中嚴重得多，以現在的狀態根本無法迎戰。他需要某種力量，把自己恢復成一貫打不倒的模樣。</p>
<p>聽到這裡，Julyan 立刻拿出隨身攜帶的 salamander oil，豪氣地表示要親自替「寶貝兒子」按摩，一口氣把人治好。但 Hildibrand 慌忙否認，顯然不太好意思接受母親親手照顧，趕緊把話題推向你，說自己不能麻煩母親，因為像這樣的重要時刻，他有可靠的搭檔可以依靠。Julyan 看穿兒子的尷尬，順勢打趣幾句，Godbert 則一本正經地替你作證，表示自己親身體會過你那「強而溫柔的指尖」有多具療效。最後，Julyan 終於同意把人交給你處理，而 Hildibrand 也立刻擺出誇張的姿勢，要你別再遲疑，像以往那樣，把全身一口氣塗滿油。Nashu 在一旁羨慕地直盯著，看得出來她也很想親自替 Inspector 按摩；Cyr 則有些無奈地要你儘快開始，別再拖延。於是你將 salamander oil 均勻抹上 Hildibrand 傷痕累累的肌肉，細細按壓揉開，Julyan 一邊看著，一邊感嘆過去無數次按摩的回憶，Godbert 則開心地說，這種療程正是 Manderville 家的家傳儀式，他也希望將來有一天能傳承給 Gigi。隨著你的指尖游走，Hildibrand 時而發出吃痛的悶哼，時而又忍不住舒暢地叫出聲。溫熱的油沿著肌理滲入，全身的酸痛漸漸退去，胸口再度燃起「正義之火」。即使你曾一度按得有點太用力，他也很快就笑著說那樣才對，肯定了這場按摩的成果。</p>
<p>感受到兒子體內重新湧動的精神，Godbert 又向前一步，表示 Hildibrand 還可以更上一層樓。接著，他從懷中取出一瓶特別的油，宣稱這是用 salamander 最純粹精華提煉而成，代代相傳的 Manderville 秘製聖油──「Salamanderville」。聽到這個名字，Hildibrand 驚呼不已，難以相信傳說中的神奇之油竟然真實存在於眼前。Godbert 認真地說明，它會讓使用者的肌肉如千陽般耀眼，幾乎不會被凡人的攻擊所傷，自己當年能在山賊群起攻擊下毫髮無傷，正是仰賴這瓶油的加護。說完，他把 Salamanderville 交到你手上，要你幫忙，讓這位已成為人父的兒子，真正成為理想中的 Manderville 男子。Nashu 一邊遮住眼睛，一邊說 Inspector 已經閃耀到快讓她失明了，Hildibrand 則深吸一口氣，宣告自己已做好覺悟，準備接受「最後的上油」。當 Salamanderville 接觸到他的皮膚，他立刻發出驚訝的喊聲，感覺那股力量流入身體每一個角落。你照指示把油推開、按進肌肉裡，他的喊聲也逐漸從驚呼變成接近咆哮的高聲，熱度與力量在體內翻騰，如解放的烈焰與肆虐的暴風。最後，他仰天大吼自己的名字與血統，宣示自己真正以 Manderville 之男的姿態重生。氣喘吁吁地站好後，他驚訝周圍的顏色變得何其鮮明，聲音變得多麼清晰，甚至連空氣中的氣味都異常濃烈。轉頭看向父母與你，他由衷地表示，是這些油，以及你那強而溫柔的指尖，讓他重新看見世界的光彩。作為重生的紳士探偵，他宣布再也不會畏懼任何違反自然的力量，接著帶著眾人，朝 Zenith、朝 Gigi 奔去。</p>
<p>在龍棲身的 Zenith 前，Hildibrand 當面擋在 Grand Sers 面前，大聲宣布自己是來接回兒子的。Dorys 顯得十分不耐，抱怨現在正是擊殺巨龍的關鍵時機，這群人偏偏挑這個時候插手。Cyr 上前一步，堅定地說戰爭已經結束，不需要再做這些事。Dorys 卻嗤之以鼻，認為和平毫無意義。在她眼中，龍的死亡象徵著新時代的開端──一個充滿火焰與鮮血的時代。只要吞下龍眼，他們就能獲得無上的力量，在戰場上贏得無盡榮耀，將自己的傳說刻進永恆。聽到這番話，Cyr 不禁打了個寒顫，無法接受為了個人名聲而犧牲無數無辜，他斷然表示絕不會讓這種事發生，就算搭上自己的性命也在所不惜。Orland 帶著冷笑回應，說要成全他的「以死相阻」並不困難，Grand Sers 也整裝待發，宣告要以「最終的終結」一舉抹殺眼前的一切。周遭的氣氛彷彿也隨之凝固，預告著一場致命衝突即將爆發。</p>
<p>然而，在真正的衝撞降臨之前，Hildibrand 把視線轉向這場風波的核心──那個小小的身影。他輕聲喚著 Gigi，希望「那雙尖銳的眼睛」不要再這樣盯著自己，像父親一般伸出手，說想帶他回他們的 gazebo。回應他的，卻是一個扭曲的聲音。孩子拒絕被叫做 Gigi，用斷斷續續的語調大喊自己是 Vivi，說自己已經全都想起來了──想起了力量，想起了使命，也想起了 Grandpapa Quan。他坦承，是自己讓 Grand Sers 重獲年輕，然而那還不夠，他需要更多，他需要 dragon 的眼睛，這樣才能真正把 Quan 帶回來。Hildibrand 溫柔地告訴他，Quan 已經離開人世，無法回到這裡；Cyr 接著補充，就算 Vivi 有辦法重塑一具肉身，並令那具軀體活動起來，那也只是一個外殼。真正能讓那個人成為「Grandpapa」的靈魂，早就無法再回來。Vivi 沒辦法接受這種說法，憤怒地喊著自己可以把一切恢復成「理想的樣子」，讓萬物變成「應該如此的狀態」，既然如此，當然可以讓 Quan 回到應有的樣貌，也可以讓 Papa Hildy 回到「正確的樣子」。Cyr 聽著那越來越吃力的聲音，急忙勸阻他，警告若是再這樣消耗力量下去，這條命恐怕會先斷在自己手裡。</p>
<p>於是 Cyr 根據在研究筆記中找到的記錄，開始解釋 Vivi 力量的真相。Grandpapa Quan 給他的並不是「讓過去重現」的能力，而是「把世界改造成他心中『應該如此』模樣」的力量。正因如此，這股魔法對 Hildibrand 完全不起作用。Cyr 認真地說明，Hildibrand 那副傷痕累累、卻每天都熱愛冒險、全力活在當下的姿態，對 Vivi 來說本來就是一種「正確的狀態」。聽到這裡，Hildibrand 立刻深表贊同，並補充這也說明為什麼 Vivi 無法讓 Grandpapa Quan 變年輕。在 Vivi 心中，Quan 從來沒有「錯誤的地方」，一切都剛剛好。那位年邁的創造者，就是他所認定的「應該如此的 Grandpapa」，兩人共度的每一天都是值得珍惜的寶貴時光。相較之下，他能夠讓 Grand Sers 年輕，是因為自己真正了解他們的，只是那些「關於年輕時英勇事跡的故事」。在想像中，Grand Sers 一直是全盛時期的英雄，因此他很容易就能把那個形象具現化，讓世界順著那個想像改變。Cyr 繼續說，事實上一開始 Grandpapa Quan 自己也不明白這股力量的本質，苦思良久都想不通，為什麼 Vivi 無法照他的願望把自己變年輕。直到後來，他才意識到，正是 Vivi 對自己的珍惜與回憶，阻止了這種改變──在那孩子心中，只有那個慈祥又有點固執的老人，沒有別的樣貌。因此，他若是想達成原本追求的「永遠年輕」，就只能破壞那段回憶。</p>
<p>然而，Quan 最終做出的選擇，正好反過來。他發現自己已經無法再把 Vivi 當成單純的偶人，而是當作家人──唯一剩下的家人，唯一的孫子。為了追求長生而犧牲這段羈絆，對他來說根本不可能辦到。於是他放棄了對不老不死的執念。Vivi 聽到這裡，反駁說自己最後還是失去了記憶，Cyr 則說，那也是出於保護。臨終前，Quan 懼怕的是，Vivi 在這個世界上孤零零一個人，終有一天會被覬覦力量的人盯上。為了避免這樣的未來，他才選擇封印 Vivi 的記憶，讓那孩子不會背負「強大魔法師」的身份，被人利用。即便如此，還是有某種東西始終沒有消失，那是遠遠超過 Quan 想像的堅韌與強大。Cyr 於是斷言，Vivi 從來沒有壞掉，也從來沒有被丟棄，Quan 想做的，只是把他「解放」而已。Vivi 困惑地問，那麼所謂的「自由」，究竟是什麼，自己又該做什麼。Hildibrand 帶著溫柔的笑容回答說，所謂自由，就是可以自己決定想做的事。Grandpapa 給他最後的禮物，是一段全新的生活，是一個屬於自己、不再被他人願望束縛的故事。從今以後，他不必為誰的「永遠年輕」而活，只要為自己而活就好。</p>
<p>這份濃烈的情感，卻被 Dorys 冷冷打斷。她不耐煩地說，大家一邊感動一邊老去，實在拖太久了，之前她已經忍受這群人插手夠久。她當場揭露了原本用來殺 dragon 的陷阱，決定乾脆趁一行人站在絕佳位置時，一併解決。就在那瞬間，Vivi 挺直身子，大聲宣告自己的全名──大魔法師 Archmagus Quan 的孫子，也是 Hildibrand Helidor Maximilian Manderville 的兒子 Vivi，這個故事的主角就是他。然後，他把最後的力量全部釋放出去。耀眼的光芒籠罩一切，時間的流向開始扭曲，彷彿被硬生生往回撥。當光芒散去，眼前的景象像什麼都沒有發生過一樣：石柱完好如初，戰場沒有半點破壞痕跡，所有人都變回先前的樣子。Cyr 茫然地望著四周，只能低聲說，是 Vivi 把時間的指針倒轉了──不只是石柱，連在場所有人都被一起拉回過去，回到「原本應該有的模樣」。Julyan 看著自己的雙手，氣得直跳腳，抱怨折騰了半天，自己的「荒唐青春」還是沒回來；Godbert 則笑得合不攏嘴，說今天的深蹲姿勢前所未有地完美，簡直達到了生涯體能的顛峰。Dorys 對他的誇耀嗤之以鼻，叫他「照年紀行事別太丟臉」，Cyr 則平靜地提醒她，Vivi 看見他們變成了什麼模樣，才選擇給了他們第二次機會。</p>
<p>Dorys 強調，她口中的「第二次機會」，就是重新過一次光輝的青年時代。然而 Orland 卻開始覺得，那種重來反而顯得有些可笑，也許 Quan 想得沒錯，變老並不一定是壞事。Gonspart 則坦白地說，自己年輕時是一個膽小鬼，如今老了，反倒能坦率說出「我愛妳，Dorys」這樣的話。Dorys 罵他是「瞎了眼的笨蛋」，但語氣已經柔和許多。就在這些話語之中，Hildibrand 終於悠悠醒來，喃喃自語自己是不是又死了一次。Cyr 趕緊向他說明，他和大家都活得好好的，全靠 Gigi──也就是 Vivi 的力量，Grand Sers 也已經被拘束。Hildibrand 大笑，說這才像他的兒子，隨即理所當然地詢問 Gigi 在哪。Cyr 一時難以啟齒，最後還是說出口：Gigi 已踏上嶄新的冒險旅程，不再待在這裡。Hildibrand 沉默了一會，輕聲說「原來如此」，接著露出有些酸澀卻真心的笑容，說既然那是 Gigi 自己的選擇，身為父親怎能不替他高興，他相信 Archmagus Quan 也一定會這麼想。當 Nashu 小心翼翼地問，接下來該怎麼辦時，他的眼睛又重新亮了起來：這個世界那麼寬廣，還有無數謎團與奇蹟等待探索，他們只要重啟那段永無止境的「難解案件之旅」就好。也許某天，在某個角落，他們還能與年輕的 Gigi 再相會。</p>
<p>Julyan 長長嘆了口氣，卻也不得不承認，這一連串事件讓她開始覺得，也許真有個孫子也不壞。她直率地說，Hildy 對 Gigi 做得很好，她和 Godbert 都為這樣的兒子感到驕傲。Hildibrand 轉身看向母親，十分認真地回敬說，他也為母親感到驕傲，因為她已經接受了「肉體美是短暫的」這件事，並且優雅地走向老去。那句話裡的「優雅」，成功觸動了某根敏感神經，下一刻，Julyan 的一擊把他像流星一樣轟上天空。Nashu 大叫「Inspector 又飛走了！」，連忙拔腿追上去。高空中，Hildibrand 遠眺東方，看到一抹奇異的光芒，鼻尖嗅到一股熟悉的味道，忍不住大喊：「那是──案件的味道！」他向地面上的朋友們喊話，要他們不用擔心自己，只要世上還有人需要伸張正義，他就會出現在那裡，最後以「再會之日，必將重逢」作為道別。地面上，Godbert 這時轉頭對 Julyan 提醒，只要 Gigi 的 core 還完好無損，他就不是真的死了。Julyan 也點頭贊同，要還在難過的兒子收起眼淚，別再像真的失去孩子那樣沮喪。Godbert 說明，Gigi 只是把 aether 花光了，暫時陷入沉眠，他的 core 會慢慢從周遭汲取 aether，等到充足之後，總有一天會重新醒來。在那之前，他會好好照顧這個孩子。</p>
<p>接著，Godbert 也主動提出，可以由他負責把 Grand Sers 押回 Ishgard。但 Cyr 仍秉持職責感，說把他們帶回去接受審判本來就是自己的工作，顯得很難輕易交給別人。不過，他很快想起剛才對那位年輕 inquisitor 說過的話，也想到自己現在被冠上的「異端」身分。以這樣的情況回到 Ishgard，他很可能直接被關進監獄，甚至被處決。他陷入一陣茫然，Julyan 卻照例用一句話劃破他的煩惱：那就搬去 Idyllshire 住在 Hildy 的 gazebo 裡吧，反正人又不在，總要有人看家打理。這個提案一開始聽起來有點不真實，但越想越合理，Cyr 最終露出笑容，愉快地接受了。遠處的天空裡，Hildibrand 依然在軌跡上飛行，Julyan 無奈地說，只能等他掉下來再說了，Godbert 則稱讚妻子的那一擊「優雅而有力」，證明她完全沒有生疏。</p>
<p>之後，在 Idyllshire，Cyr 站在你面前，回顧自己走過的路。他坦言，只要想起以前的自己，就忍不住感到羞愧。那時的他幾乎從不離開首都，死守一堆所謂「無庸置疑的事實」，讓自己被僵化的教條束縛。如果沒有遇見你、Hildibrand 和 Gigi，他大概永遠不會發現自己其實早就厭倦了那份工作，也不會知道，去追尋「完整的真相」是多麼令人心滿意足的事。他苦笑著說，被扣上異端的罪名、被迫離開 Ishgard，或許反而成了人生中最好的轉機，因為正因如此，他才得以在 Idyllshire 以「consulting inspector」的身份，開啟一段全新的生活。說到這裡，他收起感傷的語氣，表示有一個人想介紹給你認識。於是他帶你來到一旁，讓你看到經過 Godbert 改造後的 Gigi──體型變得更小，這樣一來能更有效地吸收 aether，幫助 core 慢慢恢復。Cyr 說，他們想過，如果讓這個孩子跟著你一起旅行、參與你那些宏大的冒險，也許會加快他甦醒的腳步。最後，他向你道謝，謝謝你一路以來的幫助，也希望未來還能再與你相遇。臨別前，他以 Fury 的祝福送你上路，把這位正在沉睡中的小小同伴託付給你，讓新的旅程就此展開。</p>
