    story:`<div class="clamp" data-collapsed="true"><p>Koana presents you with arms and armor crafted by Tural’s finest artisans, staking his name on their quality in both form and function. Gulool Ja can’t help but grin at how well it suits you, and Wuk Lamat laughs that with such gleaming new gear, you’re ready for anything. She urges everyone onward to the Skydeep Cenote—only for Koana to add that entry is restricted by his own orders, and so he will accompany you personally.</p><p>At the landmark, Gulool Ja admits the place unnerves him—he isn’t sure he could ever come here alone. Erenville names it quietly: the city of gold, where it all began. Krile and Alisaie feel the weight of returning, and Wuk Lamat lingers for a heartbeat before following, saying that simply standing here pulls her back to what happened before. Krile speaks of the letter that guided her across the seas and the answers she still seeks, and though she cannot know what lies ahead, she swears to walk the road to the end with all of you. Erenville cuts through the silence with a soft push forward, and you head inside.</p><p>Deep within, Y’shtola notes electropes in every direction, brimming with lightning—so much so the place feels almost alive. She has Krile try her earring against the terminal, but nothing happens. Shale tells her not to give up; the terminal reads codes, and it may simply require higher clearance. If the king’s authority has truly passed to Gulool Ja, Shale reasons, then perhaps the gate will respond to him. Gulool Ja hesitates—then tries, and the moment the power answers, a voice like an echo slips through: Zoraal Ja’s thoughts, leaving behind what he earned for another to accept…or reject. Gulool Ja recoils with a startled cry.</p><p>Krile stares at her earring in dawning certainty—so it really was the key. Y’shtola studies the opening and remarks on the difference: a voidgate torn open by brute aether is a ragged tear, but this is the stitchwork of a master—clean, precise, and dangerous in its perfection. Yet wonder can wait. If Gulool Ja can open the gate, then Sphene can close it, and so Y’shtola insists they must defend it with magicks to keep it stable and ward off interference. She can invoke the spellwork, but not sustain it alone; she needs another to channel with her. Urianger volunteers at once, and Alphinaud agrees that if coordination is required, few are better suited than Alisaie and himself.</p><p>G’raha Tia offers to stay, but Y’shtola asks him to join the expedition instead—because even if they do everything right, the gate could still close. If that happens, those on the far side may be the only ones able to devise a way to reconnect the worlds, a task she pointedly reminds him he knows well. Thancred decides he will remain to guard those maintaining the gate, ready to deal with any threat from beyond or otherwise, and Estinien adds that he will do the same—leaving you free to go in and do what you do best. You give your answer, and Alisaie accepts it with a strained smile, only to warn you not to let Thancred shoulder the burden alone.</p><p>Before you depart, each of your companions lays their resolve bare. Gulool Ja vows he will use the power he inherited for good. Erenville admits there is no telling what dangers await, but if his mother is out there, he must find her—and tell her exactly what he thinks. Krile remembers emerging from that gate twenty years ago; whether the answers lie on the other side or not, she will see this through, confessing she is nervous but that your presence gives her courage, just as it so often does for the others. G’raha Tia states the task plainly: if Sphene intends to plunder aether from other worlds, then you must stop her—she must not be allowed to harm anyone else, loved ones or strangers alike.</p><p>Y’shtola admits how hard it is not to throw herself into the light, yet she forces herself to remain behind in case the gate closes; it would not do to lose everyone, least of all you. Alphinaud says he would dearly love to accompany you, but will content himself with seeing you off and praying you find hope beyond, eager to hear your account when you return. Alisaie accepts that she is needed here and insists she is not a child anymore; she will do her part without hesitation, and you must do yours—together, you will protect what you hold dear. Estinien, characteristically, mentions having seen a large lizard on the way and declares he will hunt it later so you can share the meat while you regale him with tales after you return. Urianger assures you those remaining lack neither expertise nor experience, and Thancred promises he will keep everyone safe—so you can focus on your task. Koana, with quiet gravity, entrusts Lamaty’i to your care once more and asks you to return safely. Shale says he has done all he can, and if you should meet Cahciua, he begs you to pass along his thanks.</p><p>When the preparations are complete, Alphinaud says it is done—whenever you are ready. Alisaie swears they will keep the portal open no matter what, and Y’shtola warns that beyond lies an unknown reflection, one they cannot identify without asking an Ascian. Wuk Lamat answers with the only certainty she has: it is Sphene’s domain, the place where she brings back those who have been lost—so for now, she decides, you will call it the Unlost World. And with that name hanging like a promise, you step through.</p><p>On the far side, the awe hits like a wave. Erenville struggles to find words for what you see: a vibrant realm where the memories of the departed abide, laugh, and revel in days long gone—Living Memory, as the Endless call it. Resplendent enough to steal breath, it draws the truth from him at last: all this time, the city of gold was here. Krile whispers that this is her world, her home, and G’raha Tia confirms what it is not—neither the void nor the First, but an unknown reflection. Wuk Lamat can hardly contain herself, declaring you have stepped into Yok Huy legend, and Krile observes that the barrier between here and the Source seems thin in Yak T’el—explaining the visions and the gate’s location.</p><p>As you move on, the details sharpen. Electrope is used here too, and G’raha Tia recognizes the unmistakable design of the aetheryte. Wuk Lamat finds herself oddly nostalgic despite never having been here, noting how different it feels from Everkeep’s advanced technology—brick and stone like a journey into the past. Erenville urges you to look closer: electropes are everywhere, along with contraptions, and he believes the city’s appearance is artificial—like Sphene projecting her image onto soldiers. When G’raha Tia points out the aetheryte is identical to Everkeep’s, the conclusion follows: this place is Alexandrian, and Krile wonders if it could be Everkeep’s missing twelfth level.</p><p>Then a voice welcomes you warmly. Constancy introduces himself as an Endless, recreated from the memories of the departed—those whose souls have been exhausted—assuring you that great care is taken so your memories feel no different than when you were flesh and blood. He explains he is a caretaker of Living Memory and offers to guide newcomers. When Krile asks what sort of place this is, Constancy calls it a recreational attraction divided into four areas, each preserving scenery that once defined the continent—so what is lost is not forgotten, and precious memories endure. It was used by the living in Everkeep’s early days, then made a haven for the Endless hundreds of years later. He offers a tour and warns that preserved wildlife roams freely, but Wuk Lamat cuts in: you came to see Sphene. Constancy says you are in luck—Her Majesty is soon to enter a slumber, but there is still time. If you call to her before the Meso Terminal at the city’s center, she will likely appear. Wuk Lamat decides that is your next destination, thanks him, and promises to take the tour another time. Constancy bids you good luck.</p><p>At the Meso Terminal, Wuk Lamat calls out for Sphene—begging her to answer, insisting you need to talk. Sphene appears, quiet and almost weary that you would come here. Wuk Lamat speaks from what she believes she knows: Sphene has a good heart, her love for her people proves it, and Wuk Lamat cannot let her do what she is trying to do—because deep down, she doesn’t believe Sphene truly wants it either. Sphene answers with the dream that drives everything: a world without suffering, where nothing is lost. Yet the Endless only grow in number, and sustaining them demands ever more life force. Within the barrier, she says, they curbed the cycle of rebirth for a few hundred years—but they have reached the limit. That is why she turned to interdimensional fusion: to harvest what is needed from your world, from your people—and with the key, she will have it.</p><p>G’raha Tia challenges her—what then, after your world is plundered? Would she do the same to others? All people die eventually; if everyone becomes Endless, there will never be enough aether to sustain them—you only delay the inevitable. Krile tells Sphene plainly that if she persists in this folly, you must stand against her, because you too have people you cannot lose, places your hearts belong. Sphene addresses Lamaty’i with a sorrowful honesty: she would have loved to work hand in hand to tend your nations, but fate brought you together only after your futures were already written. The kind and gentle Queen Sphene, she declares, was too weak to serve her people—and so she will serve them no more. She will erase all memories of the living Sphene, the conscience that cursed her with softness and powerlessness. Freed from it, she will become a ruler who can protect Alexandria—a devourer of worlds. When two nations cannot protect their own without harming the other, she insists, there can be only one resolution, a hard truth she believes you understand. You steel yourself and answer, but Sphene only says time has run out: the process has begun, and it cannot be stopped. The terminal announces memory deletion in progress; upon completion, interdimensional fusion will commence. Wuk Lamat cries out for her again—too late.</p><p>Afterward, the horror settles in. Erenville reflects that the Endless exist in defiance of nature’s laws, yet exist all the same, with Sphene insisting they are no different from the living. Krile acknowledges Sphene’s good intentions, but condemns her methods—there is no cost at which you can yield. G’raha Tia says the truth he cannot avoid: the Endless were unsustainable from the first, and Sphene has been fighting a lost cause. Wuk Lamat’s frustration finally breaks into raw anger—she thought she’d come to understand Sphene, and yet now she feels utterly clueless about what to do next.</p></div><div class="expand-wrap"><button class="expand-btn" data-role="expand"></button></div>`,

    story:`<div class="clamp" data-collapsed="true"><p>トラル随一の職人たちが仕立てた武具を、コーナはあなたに手渡す。見た目だけではない、品質も機能性も保証できる――そう言い切る言葉に、グルージャは「似合う！」と無邪気に笑い、ウクラマトは光を弾く新装備を見て「これで何が来ても平気だ！」と背中を押す。目的地は天深きセノーテ。だがコーナは、立ち入りが自身の命令で制限されていることを告げ、あなたに同行すると言う。</p><p>現地に着くと、グルージャは胸の奥を押さえるようにして「ひとりじゃ来られないかも」とこぼす。エレンヴィルはそこを「黄金郷……すべての始まり」と呼び、クルルも、アリゼーも、そしてウクラマトも、再びこの地に立ったことの重みを噛みしめる。ほんの少し前に儀式で訪れたばかりなのに、その後に起きた出来事はあまりにも多い。祖父の手紙に導かれて海を越え、答えを求めてきたクルルは、前途が見えなくとも最後まで仲間と歩むと誓う。エレンヴィルが短く促し、あなたは皆とともに内部へ向かう。</p><p>天深きセノーテの深奥で、ヤ・シュトラは周囲一面のエレクトロープが膨大な雷の力を孕み、この場所そのものが生きているかのようだと言う。クルルはイヤリングを端末に当てるが反応はない。シェールは諦めるなと告げ、端末が読んでいるのはコードであり、より高い権限が必要なのだろうと推測する。そして王の権威がグルージャへ受け継がれているなら門は開くはずだと、試すよう促す。戸惑いながらも触れた瞬間、門は応え、汗水たらして得たものを遺し、それを受け入れるか拒むかはお前次第だ――ゾラージャの思念が、裂け目の向こうから滲むように響く。グルージャは思わず叫び声を上げる。</p><p>クルルはイヤリングを見つめ、確信する。ヤ・シュトラは、エーテルの爆発でこじ開けられるヴォイドゲートが現実を引き裂く傷だとすれば、これは名人の縫い目のように整い、恐るべき力だと評する。だが感嘆している場合ではない。グルージャが開けられるなら、スフェーンも閉じられる。門の安定を保ち妨害を防ぐため、魔法で防護すべきだとヤ・シュトラは言い、単独では維持できないから同調して導く相手が必要だと明かす。ウリエンジェが名乗り出るが、それでも確実ではない――力を貸してほしいと頼まれ、アルフィノは、魔法の連携が要るなら自分とアリゼーが適任だと即答する。</p><p>グ・ラハ・ティアも残ろうとするが、ヤ・シュトラは遠征班に加わってほしいと言う。万全を尽くしても門が再び閉じる可能性がある以上、向こう側で世界を繋ぎ直す手段を考える役目が必要であり、あなたと同じく彼はその経験を持つ。サンクレッドは門を維持する者たちの護衛に回り、向こう側からでもそれ以外でも脅威が現れれば対処すると宣言し、エスティニアンも同意する。あなたは中へ進み、いつものように道を切り拓け――そう背を押され、あなたは言葉で応える。アリゼーは「大丈夫」と受け止めながらも、サンクレッドひとりに背負わせるなと念を押す。</p><p>出発を前に、皆はそれぞれの決意を語る。グルージャは受け継いだ力を善のために使うと誓い、エレンヴィルは母がいるなら必ず見つけ、言うべきことを言うために進むと告げる。二十年前に門をくぐったクルルは、不安を隠さず、それでもあなたが傍にいるから勇気が湧くのだと打ち明ける。スフェーンが他世界からエーテルを奪うつもりなら、止めるしかない――グ・ラハ・ティアは、愛する者も見知らぬ誰かも、これ以上傷つけさせないと断言する。</p><p>ヤ・シュトラは光へ飛び込みたい衝動を必死に抑え、門が閉じた時に備えてここに残ると言う。アルフィノは同行できぬ無念を抱えつつ、あなたが希望を見つけることを祈り、帰還後の報告を待つと告げる。アリゼーは自分がここに必要だと受け入れ、門を守り抜くからあなたも役目を果たせと力強く言う。エスティニアンは道中で見かけた大トカゲの話を持ち出し、帰ってきたら向こうの世界の話と一緒に肉を味わおうと肩をすくめる。ウリエンジェは残る者の経験を信じ前だけを見よと諭し、サンクレッドは皆を守るから任務に集中しろと言う。コーナは「またラマチを任せる」とあなたに託し、無事の帰還を願う。シェールは、もしカフキワに会えたなら礼を伝えてほしいと頼む。</p><p>準備が整い、アルフィノが合図する。アリゼーは門を開いたまま守ると誓い、ヤ・シュトラは、向こうが未知の鏡像世界である以上、アシエンにでも尋ねない限り特定できないと告げる。だがウクラマトは、スフェーンの領域であり、失われた者たちが戻る場所だという確信だけを手掛かりに、そこを「アンロスト・ワールド」と呼ぼうと言い切る。あなたは皆とともに、その光の向こうへ踏み出す。</p><p>門を抜けた先で、言葉にならない驚嘆が胸を満たす。死者の記憶が住まい、笑い、過ぎし日を謳歌する鮮やかな世界――永久人たちはそこをリビング・メモリーと呼ぶ。エレンヴィルは、長く追い求めた「黄金郷」がここにあったのだと呟き、クルルはここが自分の世界、自分の故郷だと言う。グ・ラハ・ティアは、虚無界でも第一世界でもない未知の鏡像世界に来たのだと確かめ、ウクラマトはヨクフイの伝承に踏み込んだのだと興奮を隠さない。ヤクテル樹海ではこちらと原初世界の隔たりが薄いらしい――クルルの言葉に、幻視と門の位置が繋がっていく。</p><p>周囲を見回せば、ここでもエレクトロープが使われ、エーテライトの意匠も見覚えがある。エバーキープほどの先進技術ではなく煉瓦と石で造られた街並みに、ウクラマトは初めてなのに懐かしさを覚えるが、エレンヴィルは表面だけだと言う。至る所にエレクトロープと装置があり、スフェーンが兵に姿を投影するのと同じく、この景観は人工的なのだろう。エーテライトはエバーキープのものと同一であり、ここがアレクサンドリア由来である可能性が浮かぶ。クルルは、ここがエバーキープの失われた第十二層なのではないかと推測する。</p><p>そこへ明るい声が響く。コンスタンシーと名乗る者は、自分もあなたたちと同じ永久人であり、魂を使い尽くした死者の記憶から再生された存在だと言う。記憶の整合性には細心の配慮が払われ、肉体を持っていた頃と何も変わらない感覚で過ごせるのだと。彼は、永久人の都リビング・メモリーの管理者として来訪者を案内する役目を担い、この街は大陸を彩った景観を四つの区画に再現した娯楽施設で、失われたものを忘れぬために思い出を永遠へ残しているのだと説明する。かつては生者が利用していたが、数百年後に永久人の楽園となったのだという。案内を申し出る彼に、ウクラマトはスフェーンに会いに来たのだと告げ、コンスタンシーは、女王はまもなく眠りにつくがまだ間に合う、街の中心にあるメインターミナルの前で呼びかければ姿を現すだろうと教える。あなたは礼を述べ、まずはメインターミナルへ向かう。</p><p>メインターミナルでウクラマトが名を呼ぶと、スフェーンは静かに現れる。ウクラマトは、短い時間でも彼女の優しさと民への愛を知ったと言い、このまま続けさせるわけにはいかないと訴える。スフェーンは、苦しみのない世界、何も失われない世界を望むと語りながらも、永久人は増え続け、維持にはより多くの生命力が必要だと言う。障壁の内側で輪廻の循環を抑えてきたが限界に達した――だから次元間融合に望みを託し、鍵を得て、あなたの世界から、あなたたちから必要なものを収穫すると。</p><p>グ・ラハ・ティアは、その先で他世界にも同じことをするのかと問う。人はいつか死ぬ。全てを永久人にすれば、支えるエーテルは決して足りず、避けられぬ結末を引き延ばすだけだと。クルルは、愚行を貫くなら立ち向かわねばならないと言い、守りたい人々と帰るべき場所が自分たちにもあると告げる。スフェーンはラマチに、共に国を導けたならと悔やみつつも、出会った時には未来は既に書かれていたと語り、優しく穏やかな女王スフェーンは民に仕えるには弱すぎたのだと言い切る。そして生きていたスフェーンの記憶を消し、良心から解き放たれた存在としてアレクサンドリアを守る支配者、世界を喰らう者になると宣言する。あなたが答えを返そうとした刹那、スフェーンは「もう遅い」と告げ、工程は始まり止められないと言う。メインターミナルは記憶削除の進行を告げ、完了すれば次元間融合が開始される。ウクラマトの叫びは、光に吸い込まれていく。</p><p>後に残るのは重い現実だ。エレンヴィルは、永久人は自然の理に背きながらも存在し、スフェーンはそれを生者と同じだと言い張っていると語る。クルルは、意図が善でも手段は最悪であり、いかなる代償でも譲れないと言う。グ・ラハ・ティアは、永久人は最初から持続不可能で、スフェーンは敗北が約束された戦いを続けてきただけだと断じる。ウクラマトは苛立ちを爆発させ、スフェーンを理解したと思ったのに、今は何もわからないと叫ぶ。</p></div><div class="expand-wrap"><button class="expand-btn" data-role="expand"></button></div>`,

    story:`<div class="clamp" data-collapsed="true"><p>Koana 把一套由最頂尖工匠打造的武器與護甲交到你手上，語氣篤定地保證它不只外觀亮眼，品質與實用性也無可挑剔。Gulool Ja 立刻笑著說這身裝備一定很適合你，Wuk Lamat 也興奮地拍了拍你，覺得你穿上這套閃亮的新裝，就像什麼都難不倒你。她催著大家立刻出發前往 Skydeep Cenote，但 Koana 隨即補上一句：那裡目前依他的命令限制進入，所以他會親自陪同你們同行。</p><p>抵達入口附近後，Gulool Ja 小聲坦白這地方讓他有點害怕——他不覺得自己能一個人來。Erenville 望著眼前的景象，低低說出那個名字：黃金城，一切開始的地方。Krile、Alisaie、Wuk Lamat 也都被回到此地的感覺拉住，像是時間忽然倒流。Wuk Lamat 說 Koana 已經先進去了，可她忍不住在門前多停了一下，因為光是站在這裡，就足以讓過去的一切湧回來。Krile 想起自己循著外公的信跨海而來、一路追問答案，即使不知道前方會遇到什麼，她也會和大家一起走到最後。Erenville 簡短地催促你們往前，你便跟著眾人走入 Skydeep Cenote 的深處。</p><p>在內部的深處，Y’shtola 看著四周密佈的導電石，說那裡面蘊著龐大的雷電之力，整個空間彷彿有生命一般。她讓 Krile 把耳環貼上終端機試試，卻毫無反應。Shale 勸她別放棄，說終端機在讀取的是「代碼」，可能只是需要更高的權限，接著把目光轉向 Gulool Ja，請他試試看。若王的權威已傳到他身上，這道門理應會為他開啟。Gulool Ja 一愣，仍伸手照做——下一瞬間，門真的回應了你們，而一道像從裂縫後滲出的聲音隨之響起：那是 Zoraal Ja 留在思念中的話，將自己辛苦得來的一切遺下，任由後來者選擇擁抱或拒絕。Gulool Ja 被那股力量震得驚叫出聲。</p><p>Krile 盯著耳環，終於確信這東西的意義遠超想像。Y’shtola 觀察那道裂口，說虛界之門若是用以太強行撕開，會像現實被扯裂般粗糙，但眼前這道門卻像大師的縫線一樣整齊、精準，力量更令人忌憚。然而她很快收起感嘆：若 Gulool Ja 能打開門，Sphene 也同樣能把它關上。為了維持穩定、阻止外力干擾，必須用魔法守住這道門。她能施術，卻無法獨自長時間維持，需要另一個人與她一同引導、同步運轉。Urianger 立刻自願加入，而 Alphinaud 也說若需要施法者之間的協調配合，他和 Alisaie 正適合支援。</p><p>G’raha Tia 也提出留下，但 Y’shtola 希望他加入遠征隊。她坦言即使你們全力以赴，這道門仍可能再度關閉；若真發生那種情況，就必須由門另一側的人想辦法重新連結兩個世界，而這正是 G’raha Tia 熟悉的任務。Thancred 決定留守，守護維持門的人員，若有威脅從另一個世界或其他方向出現，他會負責處理；Estinien 也表示會一同看守，讓你能放心進去做你最擅長的事。你回以一句話表態，Alisaie 雖然嘴上說沒事，仍提醒你別把重擔全丟給 Thancred 一個人扛。</p><p>出發前，眾人把各自的決心說得清楚。Gulool Ja 說他會用繼承而來的力量去做對的事。Erenville 承認前方危險難料，但若他的母親就在那邊，他一定要找到她，還要親口把話說清楚。Krile 回想二十年前自己正是從那道門走出來的，她不知道答案是否在門的另一側，但她會走到底；她也坦白自己其實很緊張，卻因為你在身邊而得到安定與勇氣——她想，你的其他旅伴一定也常有同樣感受。G’raha Tia 則把任務定義得毫不含糊：若 Sphene 執意掠奪其他世界的以太，你們就必須阻止她，不能讓她再傷害任何人，無論是你們珍視的人，還是從未見過的陌生人。</p><p>Y’shtola 坦承自己幾乎忍不住想投入那道光，但她必須克制，因為若門關閉，她就得留在這裡應對，不能讓所有人都被困住——更不能失去你。Alphinaud 說他很想陪你一起去，但這次只能站在這裡送行，祈禱你在前方找到希望，並期待你回來後的講述。Alisaie 接受自己必須留守的事實，說她已不是孩子，她會拼盡全力守住這道門，而你也要完成你的任務，因為你們會一起守護重要的一切。Estinien 一如既往地跑偏，提到路上看到一隻很大的蜥蜴，看起來挺好吃，等你回來再去打獵，順便聽你講另一個世界的故事。Urianger 叮囑你別為留下的人擔心，專注望向前路；Thancred 再次保證會把大家護好，讓你只需集中精神面對你的目標。Koana 則鄭重地請你再次照看 Lamaty’i，並要你務必平安歸來。Shale 說他已做到所能做到的一切，若你見到 Cahciua，請代他說一聲謝謝。</p><p>當一切就緒，Alphinaud 說隨時都能出發。Alisaie 誓言會不計代價守住傳送門、讓它保持開啟；Y’shtola 提醒你們，門的另一側是未知的映照世界，除非去問亞席恩，否則根本無從判定是哪一個。Wuk Lamat 卻抓住你們唯一能確定的事：那裡是 Sphene 的領域，是她讓失去之人「回來」的地方。所以她乾脆替那個世界取名——Unlost World。你跟著她的喊聲與決意，踏入光之門內。</p><p>穿越之後，你幾乎找不到語言形容眼前的震撼。那是一個鮮明而熱鬧的世界，逝者的記憶彷彿仍在其中生活、歡笑、沉浸於往昔歲月——而那些存在稱這座城市為 Living Memory。Erenville 像終於抓住了追逐已久的答案，低聲說：原來黃金城一直都在這裡。Krile 則幾乎顫著聲音說這是她的世界、她的家。G’raha Tia 確認你們並非來到虛無界，也不是來到 the First，而是踏入一個未知的映照。Wuk Lamat 興奮得難以自持，說你們真的走進了 Yok Huy 的傳說之中；Krile 也指出在 Yak T’el 這一帶，這裡與 the Source（原初世界）之間的屏障似乎很薄，這也就解釋了 Yok Huy 的幻視與那道門的位置。</p><p>繼續深入觀察後，你們發現這裡同樣使用導電石，而眼前的以太水晶設計更讓 G’raha Tia 一眼認出端倪。Wuk Lamat 明明第一次來，卻覺得莫名懷舊；她說這裡不像 Everkeep 那樣充滿高科技，反而是磚石構成，像是走回了過去。Erenville 卻要你別被表象騙了：導電石與各式裝置遍布四周，他認為這座城市的外觀是「被製造」出來的，就像 Sphene 能把自己的影像投射到士兵身上一樣。當 G’raha Tia 指出以太水晶與 Everkeep 的相同，答案逐漸浮現：這裡帶著 Alexandria 的痕跡。Krile 甚至推測，這座城市可能正是 Everkeep 遺失的第十二層。</p><p>就在此時，一道熱情的聲音迎上來。Constancy 自報姓名，說他和你們一樣是 Endless——由耗盡靈魂的逝者記憶重塑而成的存在。他強調為了維持記憶的完整性，會讓這份「活著的感覺」與生前無異。Constancy 說自己是 Living Memory 的管理者，很樂意引導像你們這樣的來訪者。Krile 問這裡究竟是什麼地方，他便把它形容成一座娛樂性的城市：分為四個區域，重現曾定義這片大陸的景色，好讓失去之物不被遺忘，讓珍貴的回憶永遠延續。最初 Everkeep 剛建立時，這裡曾供活人使用，但數百年後被改造成 Endless 的避風港。他提議帶你們導覽，並提醒為了保存而帶來的野生生物會自由遊走；Wuk Lamat 卻急著打斷，說你們是來見 Sphene 的。Constancy 說那正好：女王即將進入沉眠，但仍有時間，只要你們在城市中心的 Meso Terminal 前呼喚她，她很可能會現身。你們謝過他，立刻朝 Meso Terminal 走去。</p><p>到了 Meso Terminal，Wuk Lamat 高聲呼喊 Sphene，要她回答，說你們必須談一談。Sphene 終於現身，語氣平靜得近乎冰冷，像是意外你們竟會走到這裡。Wuk Lamat 先以自己相信的那份溫柔開口：雖然相識不久，但她知道 Sphene 心地善良，也知道她對人民的愛是真實的，所以她不能讓 Sphene 繼續做下去——而且她相信 Sphene 內心深處也不想如此。Sphene 回以她的理想：她想要沒有痛苦的世界，想要什麼都不會失去的世界；可 Endless （以死者的記憶為本體、在 Living Memory 中被系統維持的存在）的數量只會增加，維持他們所需的生命力也只會不斷上升。她說在屏障之內，她們已經在幾百年間勉強抑制了再生循環，但如今已到極限，所以她才把希望寄託在「跨次元融合」上——要從你們的世界、從你們的人身上收割她需要的東西，而有了鑰匙，她就能做到。</p><p>G’raha Tia 立刻追問：若掠奪了你們世界的以太之後呢？她是否也會對其他世界做同樣的事？人終究都會死；若讓所有人都成為 Endless，以太永遠不可能足以支撐，這只是在延後不可避免的結局。Krile 也直言，若 Sphene 仍執意走這條路，你們就必須與她對立，因為你們也有不能失去的人，也有心之所繫的歸處。Sphene 轉而呼喚 Lamaty’i，說她原本最想與她攜手照看兩國，但命運太殘酷，等她們相遇時，未來早已寫定。她宣告那位溫柔善良的 Queen Sphene 太軟弱、無法真正守護人民，所以她不再需要那樣的自己。她要抹去「活著的 Sphene」的一切記憶，把那份良知連同柔弱一起清除，讓自己成為能保護 Alexandria 的統治者——成為吞噬世界的存在。當你準備回應時，Sphene 卻只說時間已到，程序已經開始，無法停止。終端機宣告記憶刪除進行中，完成後跨次元融合將開始。Wuk Lamat 失聲呼喊 Sphene，而回應她的只有冷酷的倒數。</p><p>一切沉下來後，Erenville 說 Endless 的存在違背自然法則，卻仍真實存在，而 Sphene 甚至把他們視為與活人無異。Krile 承認 Sphene 的意圖或許出自善意，但手段卻完全錯誤，你們無論如何都不能退讓。G’raha Tia 也指出，Endless 從一開始就無法長久維持，Sphene 只是在打一場註定失敗的仗。Wuk Lamat 的憤怒終於爆開——她以為自己已經理解 Sphene，卻在此刻發現自己仍一無所知，完全不知道接下來該怎麼做。</p></div><div class="expand-wrap"><button class="expand-btn" data-role="expand"></button></div>`,
