<p><b>The Man in Black (00:00–15:00)</b></p>
<p>Kipih Jakkya greets you brightly, remarking that it has been a while and feigning outrage at the thought that you might have forgotten her—Kipih Jakkya, reporter for the tabloid The Raven. She explains that a strange rumor has been circulating of late: travelers passing through Thanalan claim to have seen an unusual black vehicle accompanied by peculiar mechanical soldiers. Some fear they may be a new type of Garlean weapon, grave enough that the good people of Garlond Ironworks have been called upon to investigate. Sensing a compelling story that could make the front page, Kipih is determined to be the first to tell it, but she needs the help of capable adventurers. The black vehicle was most recently sighted near Black Brush in central Thanalan, she says, and she asks that if you learn anything at all, you return to her without delay.</p>
<p>Following her lead, you make your way to Black Brush, where you find a sleek black car standing idle by the roadside and a young man clad head to toe in black desperately trying to push it along. Cursing his luck and the machine’s refusal to move, he asks if there is a garage nearby, then stares blankly when you speak of Thanalan and Eorzea—names that mean nothing to him. You suggest that Garlond Ironworks and its chief engineer Cid might be able to handle such technology, and he lets out a sigh of relief, asking your name and giving his own in turn: Noctis, though you can call him Noct. Shoulder to shoulder, you help him push the car he calls the Regalia, and he mutters that it feels like déjà vu. Before long, an Ironworks engineer spots you, marvels at the mysterious vehicle, and hurries off to fetch Cid, who has been tasked by the Alliance with investigating the rumors. On arriving, Cid notes that the machine does not appear to be of Garlean make and confirms that the young man is its owner. Learning that Noctis has never even heard of Eorzea, he listens as the stranger recalls his hazy last memory: being at a Niflheim base with a strange machine, and then suddenly awakening here. Cid muses that he may have activated some manner of teleportation device. He goes on to say that reports also speak of mechanical soldiers—figures who look like men encased in armor, carrying advanced firearms yet moving with unnatural precision. Noctis identifies them as magitek troopers, MTs, robotic soldiers created by the Niflheim Empire, and Cid asks if he would investigate them in Garlond Ironworks’ stead. The most recent sightings place them near the Unholy Heir to the east. Thinking they might hold a clue to returning home, Noctis agrees, and Cid, not wishing to leave a visitor from another world to wander alone, asks you to accompany him while he remains behind to tend to the Regalia.</p>
<p>At the Clutch near the Unholy Heir, you and Noctis quickly find what you were sent to seek: squads of MTs patrolling the sands, backed by a looming magitek armor. As the FATE begins and hostile gunfire erupts, the two of you charge into the fray, cutting down the mechanical soldiers one after another until the towering armor crashes to the ground in a shower of sparks and twisted metal. When the last enemy falls silent, Noctis surveys the wreckage with a troubled frown, certain that these soldiers must have crossed over from his world at the same time he did. Yet despite the fierce battle, he finds nothing that points the way back. Frustration creeping into his voice, he admits he has no idea what to do next and decides that his best chance lies in consulting Cid. Saying that the “old geezer” seemed to know his stuff, he asks you to come along as he returns to check on the Regalia and report on what you have discovered.</p>
<p>Back at Black Brush Station, Cid greets you and asks how you fared. Hearing that you not only found the mechanical soldiers but fought them, he realizes the rumors were true and expresses a keen desire to examine their technology with his own eyes. He asks a favor of you: the next time you encounter such soldiers, salvage whatever parts you can from them. An Ironworks hand steps forward and requests that you bring any recovered components to him or his colleagues in the three city-states, so they can pass them on to the chief once his many other tasks are complete. At that moment, Noctis demands to know where his car is, and Cid explains that he moved the Regalia to the Dispatch Yard when a nosy reporter came sniffing around, so they could carry out repairs undisturbed. He has already identified the problem and believes it can be fixed, though fashioning a replacement part will take time. Before the conversation can go further, a familiar voice rings out and Kipih Jakkya hurries over, declaring that he must be the “mystery man.” She looks Noctis up and down, praising his simple yet striking style, then introduces herself as a reporter for The Raven and confirms that he is the owner of the mysterious black vehicle. When he calls it the Regalia, she repeats the name with delight and asks where he hails from and how he came to be here. Noctis replies that he is from far away, that he was on a journey and in the midst of a fight when he suddenly found himself in this world. He needs to get back, he says, because there is still so much he has to do. To Kipih, it is the perfect premise: a mysterious young man from another world, desperately seeking a way home. She presses to know what kind of journey he was on, and he tells her he was traveling with his friends to meet someone important to him. When she tries to pry into the nature of that relationship, he pushes back, pointing out that he has questions of his own. In response, Kipih offers the full reach of The Raven’s eyes and ears—she will seek out the answers he desires, if he will grant her an exclusive interview. With little to lose, Noctis agrees, and she suggests they continue their conversation in Ul’dah while she sets her contacts to work. Cid, for his part, promises to begin crafting the replacement part for the Regalia and tells you both to go about your business while he labors.</p>
<p>Later, on Emerald Avenue in Ul’dah, Noctis lets out a weary sigh and complains that what he just endured was less an interview and more an interrogation. Kipih, however, is in high spirits, declaring that he was very cooperative and that she has gathered plenty of juicy details for her feature article. She reveals that he was on his way to meet his beloved fiancée and muses that such a timeless tale of romance is sure to make the next edition of The Raven fly off the stands. Noticing your look, she hastens to add that she fully intends to keep her promise: it has been too long since she last graced the front page, but this is not only about a good story—it is also about helping Noctis find a way home. She has already put word out to her colleagues, she says, and expects to hear from them at any moment. Right on cue, a message comes through; after a brief exchange, she thanks her contact and turns back to you with a gleam in her eye. As she explains, there is now a hopeful lead. The three of you will need to take a little trip together to follow it up, so she urges you to see to your preparations and let her know when you are ready to depart.</p>

<p><b>In the Dark of Night (15:03–28:11)</b></p>
<p>After the long “interview” in Ul’dah, Noctis lets out a weary sigh and mutters that it felt more like an interrogation than anything else. Kipih Jakkya, however, already has her eyes on the next lead: more reports of mechanical soldiers, this time in the Twelveswood. Her colleague has only heard rumors, but the trail points toward Gridania, where witnesses might be found. She proposes that you all travel there together, only to realize that a newcomer like Noctis would likely lose his way in unfamiliar forests and city-streets. Smiling, she offers to personally see him to Gridania, and he readily accepts, asking her to lead the way. Thus you set out for the Black Shroud. Upon arriving in New Gridania, you find Noctis lingering at a stall in the Knot, hastily insisting that he is not slacking off. He claims he is simply looking over the clothing on display, clearly intrigued by the unfamiliar styles and fabrics he sees in this new land.</p>
<p>From there, you and your companions fan out through Gridania in search of those who have seen the mechanical soldiers. At the Rosewood Stalls, Hadrefort admits he knows nothing of the rumors, but his brother Marcquelort chimes in that an acquaintance claimed to have encountered such figures near the Hawthorne Hut in the East Shroud—shapes that at first seemed like men, but on closer inspection resembled dolls. Hadrefort bristles that his brother never thought to share this essential detail and vows that, should he die to such abominations, he will hold Marcquelort responsible. Elsewhere in the city, at the Wailing Barracks, Mitainie informs you that a sentry at Amarissaix’s Spire reported a similar sighting while patrolling the Bramble Patch: what he took for a row of scarecrows suddenly sprang to life and set upon him. Believing them to be some unknown imperial weapon, the Wood Wailers are already deliberating a response. At the White Wolf Gate, Roustebant confirms that mechanical soldiers have indeed been seen in the East Shroud, and while he lacks firsthand knowledge, he notes that the Wailers are on high alert throughout the Twelveswood. Along the way, back at Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre, Noctis can be found staring around with wide-eyed incredulity at the many Miqo’te in attendance, mumbling about cat-people everywhere and remarking that Y’jhimei had not been exaggerating. When you regroup, Kipih eagerly asks what you have learned. Whether you mention the rumor near the Hawthorne Hut or the patrol report from the Bramble Patch, she decides that if you keep watch at the Bramble Patch, you are sure to encounter something eventually. Noctis, fired up at the prospect, dashes off before she can finish warning him about the maze-like forest paths, and she quickly implores you to chase after him so he does not lose his way.</p>
<p>Out in the East Shroud, you catch up with Noctis at the Bramble Patch. He looks around, confirming that this is indeed the place and resigns himself to the “waiting game” when no enemies appear at once. For a time, the forest is quiet. Then a distant sound cuts through the stillness, and Noctis’s head snaps up. Urging you to follow, he rushes toward the source. There, in a break in the trees, you come face-to-face with a creature unlike the mechanical soldiers: a fearsome daemon. Noctis recognizes it immediately and declares that such a monster cannot be left to roam free. The duty begins, and together you leap into battle. Throughout the fight he warns you that this is no ordinary foe, shouting for you to mind the strange pillars that appear on the field. When destructive energies gather around them, he calls out that they must be dealt with, and when two rise at once, he urges that you each take one. The daemon presses you both to your limits, but step by step you dismantle its tricks, shatter the pillars, and finally bring the beast crashing down. With the enemy defeated, the duty ends in success.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, Noctis stands amid the settling dust and wonders aloud what is happening to this world. First magitek troopers, now a daemon—he cannot begin to guess what force has dragged all of this across the boundaries between realities. You suggest taking a break after such a fierce struggle, and he agrees that he could certainly use one. He proposes that you make camp, and before long the two of you are resting together beneath the forest canopy. As the firelight flickers, he turns the conversation toward you, asking what your story is and why you continue to do what you do. When you tell him that your purpose is to protect those dear to you, he says that you would get along well with Gladio, the stalwart companion who never hesitates to put himself in harm’s way for their sake. Noctis reminisces about traveling with him and the others, admitting that your answer reminds him strongly of his friends. When he tries to put his own purpose into words, he settles on the notion of keeping a promise—something he cannot hope to fulfill while stranded here. Gazing into the flames, he voices once more the quiet determination that he has to find a way back to his own world…somehow.</p>
<p>Back in Old Gridania at Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre, Noctis sighs that while it is good the daemon has been dealt with, they have once again found no clues on how to send him home. When Kipih asks whether he has found his answers, he replies that all they uncovered were more questions, such as how a daemon could have ended up in Eorzea in the first place. She asks what a daemon is, and he explains that it is a kind of monster from his world. Kipih muses that, to her untrained mind, such a being sounds similar to a voidsent, and she seizes on that comparison as a source of hope: if even a creature like that could somehow cross the boundary into this world, then surely there must be a way for Noctis to cross back again. He admits he can only hope so. Kipih promises to keep working with her colleagues to seek out new leads and tells him to hold fast for the time being. Noctis, however, would rather stretch his legs and look around the city, asking if it is all right for him to go for a walk. She concedes that it should be safe enough so long as he stays near the city, but before she finishes warning him he is already striding away. With a weary sigh, she watches him go, then turns to you and asks that you keep him company—she is not truly afraid that he will vanish, but she would feel far better knowing he is not wandering alone. She promises to have new information to share before long and urges you both to return soon. When you find Noctis again at the Knot in New Gridania, he greets you casually and tells you to reassure Kipih that she need not worry: he can take care of himself and has no intention of running off. He explains that he was simply browsing the clothes at the stall, and that while he was doing so, the shopkeeper offered him some items for free. Maisenta remarks that your friend has a fine physique and exceptional fashion sense, and that having such a handsome young man model their garments is the best advertisement they could hope for. Noctis thanks her, a little embarrassed but clearly pleased, then turns back to you with a faint smile and says he would like to keep exploring a little longer. If you are free, he asks you to hang out with him for a while as he continues to take in the sights of Gridania.</p>

<p><b>Messenger of the Winds (28:13–)</b></p>
<p>After everything that has happened, Noctis admits that he still has no idea how he is supposed to return home. For the moment, there is nothing he can do but wait for Kipih Jakkya to uncover new clues. Rather than brood, he decides to make the most of his time in this beautiful land so that he will have something to tell his friends when he finally sees them again. Confiding that he is actually a little obsessed with fishing, he explains that he goes whenever he has a spare moment—and right now, he has plenty. He resolves to visit a nearby spot in the Central Shroud and invites you to come along. At Jadeite Thick, you find him already hard at work on the riverbank, boasting that he has reeled in a dozen fish while waiting for you. As he casts his line again, he admits that he cannot help worrying about the possibility that he may never find his way back, and that the thought weighs heavily on him. Even so, standing in the quiet of the forest and focusing on the rhythm of casting and reeling helps to calm his mind and sharpen his resolve. There are people counting on him in his own world, he says—and now he is counting on you as well. Then, catching sight of the great waterwheel nearby, he brightens and suggests taking a photo together with it in the background. You agree, and he lines up the shot, announcing that he is about to capture the moment. When he sees the finished picture, he laughs that he can almost hear Prompto praising the lighting and says he cannot wait to show it to “the fellas” when he gets home. With that, he suggests that the two of you should head back.</p>
<p>Back at Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre in Old Gridania, Kipih rushes up to you and Noctis in obvious agitation, thanking the gods that you have returned safely. When Noctis asks what is wrong, she explains that a colleague has informed her the mechanical soldiers have now been sighted in Ixali territory. That alone might not be cause for alarm, but the beastmen, disturbed by the intrusion, have responded by summoning Garuda. Noctis refers to her as the “bird lady,” remarking that he is fairly sure he already dealt with a similar being back in his own world. Kipih is astonished to realize that he, like you, has slain such powers before and exclaims that he must be a primal-slayer. The term is unfamiliar to him, and he asks if a “primal” is something like an Astral or a Messenger, but quickly dismisses the distinction; whatever she is, the two of you will handle it one way or another. Kipih explains that Garuda has appeared at the Howling Eye, her northern domain, but violent winds make it nearly impossible to approach on foot. If you are determined to face her, she offers to contact Garlond Ironworks and arrange the loan of an airship. She promises to secure your transport while you prepare and bids you meet her before the Carline Canopy when you are ready. Noctis, for his part, declares that you have proven yourself a friend, and since you will be standing against Garuda together, he will lend you the “power of kings,” a special power he possesses but can share. With it, he explains, you will be able to warp about the battlefield as he does, moving swiftly and striking from afar. It may take some getting used to, but he is confident you will manage. Feeling responsible for the trouble Garuda is causing because of the magitek troopers, he insists that you must put things right. Later, in New Gridania, he tells you he is ready whenever you are, while Kipih confirms that the airship stands prepared to carry you both into battle and asks if your preparations are complete. Once you give your assent, she wastes no time in sending you aloft.</p>
<p>High above the Twelveswood, the airship bears you to the Howling Eye, where chaos has already taken hold. On the ground below, Ixal rush about in a panic: one urges his kin to run for their lives, another cries that the figure before them resembles their goddess yet is somehow not their goddess, and a third insists that whatever it is, they must flee at once. Within the sanctuary of wind, a Garuda-like being stands wreathed in unfamiliar power, speaking in a strange tongue that nevertheless reaches your ears clearly through the Echo. She wonders aloud why such clamorous creatures have summoned her and what strange land she has been drawn into. Then her gaze falls upon Noctis, whom she addresses as the Chosen King. Understanding at last how she came to be here, she declares that his presence drew her across the boundary between worlds. If it is power that he seeks, she commands him to take up his weapon and prove himself in battle so that she may judge whether he is worthy. The duty begins, and Noctis turns to you, telling you it is time to put your newly granted power to use. As the clash is joined, he encourages you not to worry—that you will soon get the hang of it and that together you will warp circles around Garuda. At his urging, you employ the special duty action Warp-strike to dart across the field and strike from afar. Noctis calls for you to coordinate your movements, insisting that your attacks must land in unison, and when you time your blows together he praises your teamwork and urges you to keep it up. When Garuda gathers strength for a devastating attack, he shouts for you to get clear, then warns that simply running will not be fast enough and tells you to warp to a nearby pillar. Even when the onslaught threatens to overwhelm you, he leaps in to cover you, insisting that he will take it from there. Little by little, your combined efforts turn the tide, and eventually the battle ends in victory.</p>
<p>In the quiet that follows, Noctis remarks that you pack a serious punch and says he is impressed. The Garuda-like being, still speaking in that otherworldly language that only you can understand through the Echo, declares that the Crystal has indeed chosen well and acknowledges the strength of Noctis and his companion alike. Noctis grumbles that gods always seem to insist on tests and wonders if they must always be so skeptical. In response, she states that it is decreed: they grant their power only at the peril of the world, never to one who has not been tested. At that moment, Cid arrives on the scene, apologizing for the delay. He explains that the Regalia is unlike any machine he has ever seen, and that it took him some time to become acquainted with its workings, but he has now finished the repairs and declares the car as good as new. Noctis is delighted and says he owes Cid more than he can express. Then the Garuda-like being speaks again, addressing Noctis by name. She tells him that there is much he has yet to accomplish on Eos and that his presence in this world serves as an anchor, allowing her to forge a link between the two realms. For his sake, she will open the way home, but warns that the gate cannot remain for long and urges him not to tarry. He nods and thanks her, then mutters that divinities are impossible to understand—one moment trying to kill you, the next helping you. Turning to you, he thanks you for your company, saying that it was nice traveling around together. When you encourage him—whether by saying you had fun and would like to do it again sometime, or by telling him to take care of things back home—he agrees that you will have to hang out again someday. Finally, he says that he had best be going, as he has a promise to keep, and bids you take care. With that, he steps toward the light and vanishes through the gate between worlds.</p>
<p>Back in New Gridania, as the radiance fades, Kipih Jakkya remarks that just before Noctis entered the portal, she could have sworn she saw a woman within the light—an ethereal figure clothed all in white. Cid confirms that he saw her as well and says she looked as though she had been waiting for Noctis, guiding him onward, leading him to suspect that they shared a deep bond. Kipih wonders aloud if the woman might have been his fiancée, while Cid allows that it is possible, though perhaps not; the only one who could say for certain has already disappeared into the light. Regardless of who or where she may be, Kipih hopes that Noctis and his beloved are reunited. With events still fresh in her mind, she resolves to return to her office at once and set quill to parchment, thanking Cid for his cooperation. Before she goes, she turns to you and offers her deepest thanks, saying that thanks in no small part to your efforts, Noctis has found his way home and her article can reach a fitting conclusion. She urges you not to miss it when it is published. After she departs, Cid reflects that Noctis was a strangely charismatic young man and that, in the end, you never did learn the exact circumstances that brought him here. If, as the Garuda-like being suggested, he has important duties waiting for him back on Eos, perhaps his time in Eorzea was a trial he simply had to overcome along the way. In any case, Cid concludes that your work here is done and offers a final blessing for the road ahead: wherever Noctis’s long journey takes him, may he ever ride in the light of the Crystal.</p>

<p><b>黒尽くめの青年 (00:00–15:00)</b></p>
<p>キピ・ジャッキヤは、懐かしそうな笑みを浮かべてあなたに挨拶し、「久しぶりね、まさかあたしのことを忘れてないわよね？」と言いながら、自分が噂好きたちの愛読誌『週刊レイヴン』で記事を書いている記者キピ・ジャッキヤであると名乗る。最近ザナラーンでは、黒光りする見慣れない乗り物と、妙に機械じみた動きをする兵士たちを見かけたという噂が広がっているのだという。中には、ガレマール帝国の新型兵器ではないかと案じる声もあり、その調査にはガーロンド・アイアンワークスまで呼び出されているらしい。これは読者の心をつかむ格好の特集記事になると直感した彼女は、誰よりも早く真相を掴むためには腕の立つ冒険者の協力が不可欠だと打ち明ける。問題の黒い乗り物は、最近では中央ザナラーンのブラックブラッシュ周辺で目撃されたという。何か手掛かりを得たなら、すぐに自分のもとへ知らせてほしい──そう頼まれ、あなたは現場へ向かうことになる。</p>
<p>キピの話を頼りにブラックブラッシュへ赴くと、道端で黒い車が立ち往生しているのが目に入る。その傍らでは、黒い衣服に身を包んだ若者が一人で車を押しており、動く気配のない相棒に悪態をつきながら、この辺りに修理してくれる場所はないかとあなたに尋ねてくる。しかし、あなたがザナラーンやエオルゼアの名を口にしても、彼はまるで聞き覚えがない様子だ。そこであなたは、ガーロンド・アイアンワークスと、その主任技師であるシドなら、この謎めいた機械についても何とかしてくれるかもしれないと提案する。若者は安堵の息をつき、あなたの名を確かめたあと、自分はノクティス──ノクトと呼んでくれ、と笑みを浮かべて名乗る。彼が「レガリア」と呼ぶ車の後部に、二人で肩を並べて力を込めて押していると、やがてあなたに見覚えのあるアイアンワークスの技師が駆け寄り、同盟からの依頼で調査に来ているシドを呼びに走っていく。ほどなくして現れたシドは、車体を一目見てガレマール製の魔導技術とは系統の異なる機械だと見抜き、若者がその持ち主であることを確認する。さらに、ノクティスがエオルゼアという土地そのものを知らないと知ると、彼の話に耳を傾ける。ノクティスは、最後に覚えているのはニフルハイム帝国の基地で奇妙な装置に遭遇したことであり、その直後にこの世界で目を覚ましていたのだと語る。シドは、世界と世界を繋ぐ転送装置のようなものが作動したのではないかと推察し、同時期に各地で目撃されている機械仕掛けの兵士たちについても説明する。全身を鎧で覆い、銃火器を構えながら、不自然なほど効率的な動きを見せる兵士たち──その特徴を聞いたノクティスは、自分の世界で恐れられる魔導兵、すなわちニフルハイム帝国が造り出した機械兵に違いないと断言する。最近の目撃情報では、東方の岩山「アンホーリー・エア」付近でその姿が見られたという。故郷への帰還の手掛かりになるかもしれないと考えたノクティスは、調査を引き受ける決意を固めるが、シドは異世界からの来訪者をひとりきりで歩かせるわけにはいかないと、あなたに同行を頼み、自身はレガリアの整備に専念することにする。</p>
<p>ザナラーンの岩場「ザ・クラッチ」付近へと向かうと、ほどなくして噂の正体が姿を現す。隊列を組んで進軍する魔導兵の一団と、その背後に控える巨大な魔導アーマーが、あたりをうろついていたのだ。発生した共同任務に参加したあなたとノクティスは、押し寄せる機械兵たちに武器を抜いて立ち向かい、銃火と魔導光が飛び交う中で次々と撃破していく。やがて、唸りを上げて迫ってきた巨大な魔導アーマーとの激しい戦いを制し、火花と金属片を撒き散らしながら地に崩れ落とさせることに成功する。戦いが終わると、ノクティスは沈黙した魔導兵たちを見下ろし、自分の世界で見慣れた兵器が、そのままこの地へ流れ込んできたのだと苦い表情を浮かべる。だが、命懸けで敵を倒してみせたところで、元の世界へ戻る方法という肝心の手掛かりは何ひとつ見つからなかった。苛立ちを隠せない彼は、それでも今はシドの知恵に頼るしかないと判断し、「あの頑固そうな親父なら何か思いつくかもしれない」と言いながら、あなたにも同行を求めて、ふたたびレガリアのもとへ戻ることにする。</p>
<p>ブラックブラッシュ停車場に戻ると、シドは二人を出迎え、調査の結果を尋ねる。噂どおり機械兵と巨大な魔導アーマーが現れ、すでに撃退されたと知ると、その技術を自らの目で確かめたいと願い、今後同じような兵器と遭遇した際には、可能な限り部品を回収してアイアンワークスに届けてほしいと頼む。傍らにいた技師も前に出て、三国にいる同僚たちが、あなたから託された部品を責任をもってシドのもとへ届けると約束する。その折、ノクティスがレガリアの行方を気にして問いただすと、シドは、詮索好きな記者に嗅ぎつけられぬよう、車をディスパッチヤードへ移して修理に専念していること、そして故障の原因を突き止め、時間さえかければ直せそうだと説明する。ちょうどそのとき、噂の張本人ともいえるキピ・ジャッキヤが勢いよく駆け込んできて、「黒い乗り物の持ち主」に違いないとノクティスを指さす。彼女は、目の前の青年の装いを「シンプルだけれど細部が凝っていて、とてもいいわね」と褒め、改めて『週刊レイヴン』の記者として名乗りを上げると、彼こそが謎の黒い乗り物の持ち主なのかと問いかける。ノクティスが車の名を「レガリア」だと答えると、キピはその響きに感心しながら名前を繰り返し、この世界では見たこともない優雅な乗り物だと目を輝かせる。そして、彼がどこの世界から来たのか、どうしてここにいるのか事情を尋ねると、ノクティスは、遥か遠い場所から仲間たちと旅をしている最中に戦いへ巻き込まれ、気がつけばこの世界にいたのだと打ち明ける。まだやらなければならないことが山ほどあるから、何としてでも元の世界へ戻らなければならない──そう語る青年の姿に、キピは読者の心をつかむ物語の匂いを嗅ぎ取る。異世界からやってきた青年が、必死に帰り道を探している……そんな筋書きこそ、特集記事にうってつけだと感じた彼女は、どのような旅をしていたのか詳しく聞き出そうとし、ノクティスが「仲間たちと共に、大切な婚約者に会いに行く途中だった」と話すと、その関係についても踏み込んで尋ねようとする。しかし、問いが矢継ぎ早になると、ノクティスはさすがに戸惑いを見せ、自分にも知りたいことが山ほどあるのだと抗議する。そこでキピは態度を改め、『週刊レイヴン』が持つ情報網を総動員して彼の疑問に答える手掛かりを集める代わりに、自分に独占取材をさせてほしいと提案するのだった。ノクティスは少し考えた末、その申し出を受け入れ、彼女の案内でウルダハへ向かって話を続けることになる。シドはその背を見送りつつ、レガリアの修理に必要な部品づくりに取りかかると告げ、しばらくは自分に任せて、二人は自由に動いて構わないと伝える。</p>
<p>やがてウルダハのエメラルドアベニューで長い取材を終えるころには、ノクティスはすっかり疲れた様子で、今のはインタビューというより尋問だったとぼやく。一方のキピは上機嫌で、ノクティスがとても協力的だったおかげで記事の「おいしいネタ」をたっぷり手に入れたと満足げに語り、彼が仲間たちと共に大切な婚約者のもとへ向かう旅の途中、この世界に迷い込んでしまったのだと説明する。離れ離れになった恋人たちが再会を目指す物語──そんな古びることのない恋愛劇なら、次号の『週刊レイヴン』は飛ぶように売れるに違いないと目を輝かせるが、あなたの視線に気づくと、すぐに表情を引き締める。久しぶりに一面を飾る好機であることは事実だが、これは同時に、遠い世界から来た青年が必死に帰り道を探しているという現実の話でもある、と。彼女はすでに各地の記者仲間や情報通たちに連絡を取っており、まもなく何らかの報せが届くはずだと告げる。その言葉どおり、程なくして連絡が入り、耳を傾けたキピの瞳に希望の光が宿る。彼女はノクティスとあなたに向き直ると、新たな手掛かりが見つかったこと、そしてその真相を確かめるために三人で小さな旅に出る必要があることを告げ、身支度を整えたうえで、自分に声をかけてほしいと微笑むのだった。</p>

<p><b>闇夜に来たる者 (15:03–28:11)</b></p>
<p>長い取材を終えたあと、ノクティスは大きく息を吐き出し、今のはインタビューというより尋問だったとぼやく。そんな彼の苦情にはあまり耳を貸さぬ様子で、キピ・ジャッキヤは次の手掛かりの話を切り出す。今度は、十二神に守られた森であるトゥエルブズウッドでも、機械仕掛けの兵士たちが目撃されているというのだ。詳しい話は同業の記者仲間が噂を聞きつけただけで、真偽はまだ定かではないが、足取りを追うのであれば、まずはグリダニアで目撃者を探すのがよいだろうと彼女は言う。ところが、ノクティスはこの世界に来たばかりの旅人であり、見知らぬ森や街の中で迷子になってしまう可能性も高い。そこでキピは、彼をグリダニアまで案内する役目を自ら買って出て、ノクティスも素直にそれを受け入れ、「案内は任せる」と笑みを返すのだった。こうして一行は黒衣森へと向かい、やがて新市街に辿り着く。するとノクティスは、ノットの露店で足を止め、慌てて「サボってるわけじゃない」と言い訳しながら、並べられた服を興味深そうに見比べている。見慣れない布やデザインに、異世界の旅人なりの好奇心が刺激されているようだった。</p>
<p>その後、あなたたちはグリダニアの各所に散り、機械兵に関する目撃情報を集めることにする。旧市街のローズウッド商店街では、ハドレフォールが噂については何も知らないと首を振る一方で、兄弟のマルクケロールが、東部森林のホーソン・ハット付近で妙な兵士を見かけた者がいると語る。その知人は、最初こそ普通の人間だと思ったが、注意深く観察すると、むしろ人形のような姿をしていたと話していたらしい。そんな重大な話をなぜ共有しなかったのかと、ハドレフォールは弟を責め立て、もしあのような怪物に襲われて命を落とすことがあれば、その責任はそっくり弟に負わせると憤る。別の場所、嘆きの戦旗亭では、ミタイニーがアマリサイクスの塔を警備していた槍隊の斥候からの報告を教えてくれる。彼は、ブランブルパッチ付近の巡回中、畑に立つ案山子だと思っていた影が突然動き出し、襲いかかってきたのだと言うのだ。まだ正体は掴めていないが、これまでにない帝国製の兵器ではないかと疑っており、森都の守り手たちは対処を協議している最中だという。さらに白狼門に立つルーストバンは、機械兵が東部森林で目撃されていること、そして詳細こそ知らないものの、トゥエルブズウッド全域で双蛇党の警戒態勢が強まっていると告げる。その道すがら、ミィ・ケット野外音楽堂に立ち寄ったノクティスは、辺り一面にいる猫のような耳と尾を持つ人々を見回し、「猫みたいな人があちこちにいる」と半ば呆然と呟き、かつて聞いた話が誇張ではなかったのだと実感している様子だ。やがて再び合流すると、キピは期待に満ちた目で成果を尋ねる。ホーソン・ハット付近での目撃談を挙げようと、ブランブルパッチ周辺での襲撃事件を報告しようと、彼女は最終的に、ブランブルパッチで張り込んでいれば、いずれ奴らの姿を捉えられるはずだと結論づける。するとノクティスはすっかり闘志を燃やし、「だったらさっさと行こう」とばかりに駆け出してしまい、キピが森の迷路のような道を注意しようとしたときには、すでにその背中は遠ざかっていた。彼女は慌ててあなたに、ノクティスを追いかけて道案内をしてほしいと頼み込む。</p>
<p>東部森林のブランブルパッチへ辿り着くと、ノクティスはあたりを見回しながら、どうやらここが噂の場所らしいと呟く。しかし周囲には何の気配もなく、しばらくは「待つしかない」と腰を据えることになる。森に静寂が満ちるなか、ふいに遠くから不穏な物音が響き、ノクティスは顔を上げて走り出した。あなたも後を追い、音のした方角へ向かうと、木々の合間に広がる開けた場所で、機械兵とは異なるおぞましい存在と対峙することになる。それは、ノクティスが一目で正体を見抜いたデーモンだった。このまま森の中をうろつかせておくわけにはいかないと彼は言い放ち、あなたと共に武器を構える。共同任務が開始され、激しい戦いが幕を開ける。ノクティスは戦いの最中、「ただの魔物じゃない」と警告し、戦場に現れた奇妙な柱に注意するよう叫ぶ。柱に力が集まり始めると、「あれをどうにかしないと危険だ」と指示を飛ばし、二本同時に現れたときには「片方は自分が引き受けるから、もう一方を頼む」と声を掛ける。デーモンは次々と罠めいた攻撃を繰り出すが、あなたたちは一つひとつその仕掛けを見破り、柱を破壊しながらじわじわと追い詰めていく。やがて決定的な一撃が決まり、凶悪な魔物は火花と共に崩れ落ち、共同任務は無事成功に終わるのだった。</p>
<p>戦いが終わったあと、ノクティスは舞い上がる土埃の中で立ち止まり、いったいこの世界で何が起きているのかと呟く。魔導兵に続いて、今度は自分の世界で見慣れたデーモンまで現れたのだ。何が境界を越えさせたのか、想像もつかない。あなたが激戦の疲れを気遣い、ひとまず休もうと促すと、彼も「さすがに一息入れたいところだ」と同意し、その場で野営の支度を始めることにする。森の木々に囲まれた簡素なキャンプを整え、火が静かに揺らめき始める頃、ノクティスはあなたの方へ視線を向ける。そして、自分が事情を話したのだから、今度はあなたの番だと言わんばかりに、なぜ冒険者として歩き続けているのか、その理由を尋ねてくる。あなたが「大切な人たちを守るためだ」と答えると、彼は感心したように頷き、「その考え方なら、グラディオときっと気が合う」と笑う。いつも仲間を守るためなら、迷わず自分の身を盾にする大柄な男のことを思い浮かべ、共に旅をしてきた仲間たちの姿を重ね合わせながら、あなたの言葉が自分の記憶を刺激したのだと語る。そして、自分の目的をひと言で表すなら、それは「ある約束を果たすこと」だと絞り出すように言う。しかし、この世界に閉じ込められている限り、その約束を果たすことはできない。揺れる炎をじっと見つめながら、ノクティスは「だからこそ、どうにかして元の世界へ帰らなければならない」と、小さく、しかし確かな決意を繰り返す。</p>
<p>やがて旧市街のミィ・ケット野外音楽堂に戻ると、ノクティスは、デーモンを片付けられたのは良かったものの、またしても帰還の手掛かりは見つからなかったと溜め息をつく。キピが「探していた答えは見つかったか」と問いかけると、「見つかったのは新たな疑問だけだ」と肩をすくめ、どうやってデーモンのような存在までもがこの世界に流れ着いたのか見当もつかないと打ち明ける。キピがその名も聞き慣れない魔物について尋ねると、ノクティスは、自分の世界に棲む一種の怪物だと説明する。キピは専門家ではないと前置きしたうえで、それはヴォイドから来る魔物のような存在に近いのではないかと考え、そこに一筋の希望を見出す。あのような怪物でさえ、何らかのきっかけでこの世界に迷い込んできたのだとしたら、同じようにノクティスが元の世界へ戻る道だって、きっとどこかに存在するはずだ──そう力を込めて言葉を紡ぐ。ノクティスは、小さく「そうだといいんだが」と答えるしかない。キピは同僚たちと共に新たな手掛かりを探し続けると約束し、今はしばし状況が動くのを待ってほしいと告げる。だがノクティスは、じっと待つより周囲を歩き回り、この街をもう少し見てみたいと言い出す。森都の近くにさえ留まっていれば危険は少ないだろうと、キピは渋々それを許可するものの、言い終わる前に彼はすでに歩き出してしまい、彼女はまたしても溜め息をつく。とはいえ、ノクティスが黙って姿を消してしまうとは思わないものの、やはり一人で歩かせるのは心許ない。そこで彼女はあなたに、彼のそばについていてほしいと頼むと共に、そう遠くないうちに新しい情報を用意しておくから、二人とも必ず戻ってくるようにと念を押す。やがて新市街のノットにいるノクティスを見つけると、彼は軽く手を挙げ、「心配はいらない」と言ってキピへの伝言を託す。自分の身は自分で守れるし、勝手にどこかへ消えるつもりもないのだと。そして、さきほどまで露店で服を見ていたところ、店主が気前よく品物をいくつか勧めてくれたのだと嬉しそうに教えてくれる。メイサンタは、彼の引き締まった体つきと優れた服の着こなしを褒めたうえで、こうした若く魅力的な客に衣服をまとってもらうのが、何よりの宣伝になるのだと微笑む。ノクティスは照れくさそうに礼を言い、それからあなたの方を振り向いて、もう少しこの街を歩いてみたいのだが、一緒にぶらついてくれないかと誘いかけるのだった。</p>

<p><b>来訪せし風の御使 (28:13–)</b></p>
<p>ノクティスは、これまでの出来事を振り返りながら、結局のところ今もなお元の世界への帰り方がまったくわからないのだと正直に打ち明ける。今できることといえば、キピ・ジャッキヤが新しい手掛かりを見つけてくれるのを待つことくらいだろう、と自嘲気味に肩をすくめるが、このまま塞ぎ込んでいても仕方がないとも感じていた。せっかく遠く離れた美しい地に来たのだから、仲間たちに語れる思い出をひとつでも多く作っておきたい──そう考えた彼は、ここで少しばかり息抜きをすることに決める。見た目にはそうは見えないかもしれないが、自分は釣りが大好きで、時間さえあれば竿を出すのだと照れくさそうに告白し、今はまさにその「時間」があるのだから、近場の釣り場に行ってみようと誘いかける。こうしてあなたは中央森林のジェダイト樹林へ向かい、川辺で待っていたノクティスと合流する。すでに何度も竿を振っていたらしく、「もう十匹以上は釣った」と言って得意げに笑う彼は、それでも心の奥では不安を抱えていた。もしこのまま帰り道を見つけられなかったらどうしよう──そんな考えが頭をよぎるたびに気分が沈むのだと打ち明ける。しかし、静かな森の中で糸を垂らし、目の前の水面に集中していると、不思議と心が落ち着き、やるべきことに意識を向け直すことができる。自分には帰りを待っている人たちがいて、その期待に応えなければならない。そして今の自分は、あなたにも頼っているのだと言葉にする。やがて、近くにある巨大な水車に気づいたノクティスは、せっかくだから記念に写真を撮ろうと提案し、あなたと並んでレンズに収まる準備を整える。「かっこよく撮ろうぜ」と言って構えたあと、彼はシャッターを切り、出来上がった一枚を見て満足げに微笑む。「プロンプトなら“光の感じがサイコーだ！”って言うに決まってる」と冗談めかして言い、これを故郷で仲間に見せるのが楽しみだと語ると、そろそろ戻ろうかと促すのだった。</p>
<p>旧市街のミィ・ケット野外音楽堂に戻ると、キピ・ジャッキヤが慌てた様子で駆け寄り、ふたりが無事に戻ってきたことに安堵の声を上げる。ノクティスが何事かと問いかけると、彼女は同業の記者仲間から新たな情報が入ったのだと説明する。機械仕掛けの兵士たちが、今度はイクサル族の領内にも現れたというのだ。それ自体はただの侵入事件で済むかもしれないが、彼らは不穏な来訪者に強い警戒心を示し、その結果、守護神たるガルーダを召喚してしまったらしい。ノクティスは「あの鳥みたいな女か」と呟き、自分の世界ではすでに似た存在を倒したことがあるとさらりと言ってのける。その言葉を聞いたキピは目を見開き、あなたと同じく彼もまた力ある存在を打ち倒してきた「蛮神殺し」なのだと驚愕する。ノクティスは「プライマル」という言葉に首をかしげ、それが自分の世界で言うアストラルやメッセンジャーに似た存在なのかと尋ねるが、区別について深くこだわるつもりはないようだ。いずれにせよ、こちらが対処するしかないのだと腹を括り、ガルーダがどこに現れたのかを尋ねる。キピは、北方にある彼女の領域ハウリングアイに顕現したこと、そして周囲には激しい風が吹き荒れ、とても地上から近づける状況ではないことを伝える。それでもなお戦いを望むのであれば、ガーロンド・アイアンワークスに連絡して飛空艇を借り受ける手配をすると約束し、自分が輸送手段を整えているあいだに準備を進め、整い次第カーラインカフェ前で合流してほしいと告げる。一方ノクティスは、ここまで共に行動してきたあなたを「信頼できる仲間」と認め、共にガルーダに立ち向かうのなら、自分の特別な力である「王の力」を分け与えようと申し出る。それを使えば、自分が戦いの中で見せてきたように、一瞬で戦場を駆け巡り、遠くから敵へと飛び込むことができるのだという。慣れが必要かもしれないが、あなたならすぐに使いこなせるはずだと励まし、機械兵たちが原因でガルーダが暴れているのであれば、自分にも責任があるのだと語って、事態を正すべく立ち上がる決意を示す。やがて新市街に出ると、ノクティスは「いつでも行ける」と準備万端であることを告げ、キピはあなたとノクティスを戦場へ運ぶ飛空艇の用意が整ったと知らせる。準備ができているか最終確認をとったのち、彼女は迷いなくふたりを乗せた飛空艇を出立させるのだった。</p>
<p>トゥエルブズウッド上空を飛ぶ飛空艇は、やがてハウリングアイへと到達し、そこではすでに混乱が広がっていた。地上ではイクサル族が右往左往し、「逃げろ、命が惜しければ走れ！」と叫ぶ者や、「姿形こそ我らの女神に似ているが、あれは女神ではない」とおののく者、「あれは何か別の恐ろしいものだ、ここから立ち去らねばならない」と仲間に促す者など、恐怖に駆られた声が飛び交っている。風の渦巻く聖域の中央には、見慣れたガルーダとはどこか異なる気配をまとった存在が佇み、異国の言葉で話しているにもかかわらず、その声は「光の戦士」の耳にはエコーを通して鮮明に響いてくる。彼女は、なぜ喧しい異形の者たちに呼び出されたのか、この見知らぬ土地は何なのかと訝しみ、その視線をゆっくりとノクティスへと向ける。やがて彼女は、目の前の青年こそが「選ばれし王」ノクティスであると見抜き、彼の存在こそが自分をこの世界へと導いた原因なのだと悟ったように告げる。そして、もし自らの力を求めるのであれば、武器を手に取り、戦いの中でその価値を示してみせよと挑戦を叩きつけるのだった。こうして共同任務が開始され、ノクティスはあなたの方を振り向き、新たに授けた力を実戦で試す時だと言って笑う。戦闘が始まると、彼は「すぐに慣れるさ」と励ましながら、ふたりでガルーダの周囲を駆け回り、瞬時に間合いを詰める戦い方を指示する。あなたが専用アクション「ワープストライク」を用いて遠距離から斬り込むと、ノクティスは連携を意識するよう呼びかけ、「同時に叩き込まなきゃ意味がない」とタイミングを合わせることの重要性を説く。ふたりの攻撃が見事に合わさると、彼は「これぞ連携だ」と喜び、引き続きその調子で行こうと声を張り上げる。やがて、ガルーダが大技の気配を見せると、ノクティスは「何か来る、離れろ」と警告し、走るだけでは間に合わないと判断すると、近くに現れた柱へワープするよう指示する。攻撃の激しさに押し潰されそうになったときでさえ、彼はあなたの身を案じて「ここからは任せろ」と前に出て攻撃を引き受ける。そうしてふたりで少しずつ押し返し、ついにはガルーダを打ち倒すことに成功するのだった。</p>
<p>戦いが終わり、ノクティスはあなたの腕前を称え、「本当に強いな」と素直な感嘆の声を漏らす。すると先ほどまで敵として立ちはだかっていたガルーダに似た存在が、再びエコーを通じた言葉で語りかけてくる。クリスタルは確かに良き選びをしたと告げ、ノクティスと、その隣に立つあなたの力を認めるのだ。ノクティスは、どこの神々もやたらと試練を課したがるものだと苦笑し、「そんなに疑い深くしなくてもいいだろ」とぼやくが、彼女は「試されぬ者に力を授ければ、その代償は世界が払うことになる」と言い切り、試練の存在理由を簡潔に示す。そのとき、少し遅れてシドが駆けつけ、「待たせてしまってすまない」とふたりに声をかける。彼は、これまでに見たこともない構造を持つレガリアに慣れるまで時間を要したものの、ようやく修理を完了させることができたと報告し、今の彼女は新品同様の状態だと胸を張る。ノクティスは心からの感謝を告げ、自分ではとても返しきれないほどの借りができたと笑う。その様子を見届けたガルーダに似た存在は、今度は改めてノクティスの名を呼びかける。彼女は、故郷の世界エオスには、まだ彼が果たさねばならない事柄が数多く残されていること、そして今この世界にいる彼の存在こそが錨となり、ふたつの世界を繋ぐことを可能にしているのだと説明する。彼のために、今ここに境界を越える門を開こう──ただし、その門は長くは持たぬゆえ、立ち止まってはならぬと忠告する。ノクティスは短く礼を述べると、「神様ってやつは、さっきまでこっちを殺そうとしてたのに、次の瞬間には助けてくれる。本当に理解できない」と苦笑しながら、それでも助力に感謝の意を示す。そしてあなたに向き直り、これまで一緒に旅ができて楽しかったと礼を述べる。あなたが「また一緒に遊ぼう」とか「故郷でやるべきことを果たしてくれ」と声を掛ければ、彼は必ず笑顔で応え、いつか必ずまた会おうと約束する。最後に、まだ守らなければならない約束があるのだと言い残し、「そろそろ行かないとな」と別れの言葉を告げると、光の門へと足を踏み出し、その姿を世界の狭間へと消していくのだった。</p>
<p>やがて光が収まると、グリダニア新市街に戻ったキピ・ジャッキヤは、ノクティスが門の中へ消える直前、光の中に白い衣をまとった女性の姿が見えたような気がしたのだと話し出す。彼女はどこか現実離れした美しさをまとい、まるでノクティスを待ち、導いているかのように見えたと振り返る。その言葉にシドも頷き、自分も同じ姿を目にしたと告げる。あの女性は確かにノクティスの帰りを待っていたように感じられ、ふたりの間には深い絆があるのだろうと推し量る。キピは、もしかすると彼の婚約者なのではないかと期待を込めて口にするが、シドは「そうかもしれないし、そうでないかもしれない」と静かに答え、真実を知りうる唯一の人物はすでに光の中へ消えたのだと続ける。それでもキピは、ノクティスの婚約者がどこにいようと、ふたりが再び巡り会えることを願わずにはいられないと微笑み、出来事の記憶が鮮明なうちに記事を書き上げるべく、執務室に戻る決意を固める。そして、これまでの協力に対してシドへ礼を述べたあと、最後にあなたへと向き直り、最大の感謝を捧げる。あなたの助力があったからこそ、ノクティスは無事に故郷への道を見つけることができ、自身の記事も劇的な結末を迎えられるのだと語り、完成した号をぜひ見逃さないでほしいと言い残して去っていく。キピが去ったのち、シドは、ノクティスという青年が不思議な魅力を持った人物だったとしみじみ振り返る。最後まで、彼がどのような経緯でこの世界に呼び込まれたのかはわからずじまいだったが、あのガルーダに似た存在の言葉どおり、故郷エオスには彼が成し遂げねばならないことが残されているのだろうと考える。そして、今回の出来事もまた、彼の長い旅路の一部として乗り越えるべき試練だったのかもしれないと結ぶと、「ともあれ、こちらでやるべきことは終わった」と言ってあなたの肩を叩き、どれほど長い道のりであろうとも、ノクティスがいつまでもクリスタルの光に照らされながら進んでいけるようにと静かに祈りを捧げるのだった。</p>

<p><b>身著黑衣的青年 (00:00–15:00)</b></p>
<p>Kipih Jakkya 帶著熟悉的笑容向你打招呼，說好久不見，又故作生氣地問你該不會已經忘了她──The Raven 的記者 Kipih Jakkya。她說，最近在 Thanalan 流傳著一個奇怪的傳聞：有許多旅人聲稱，在路上看見過一台異常的黑色載具，身邊還跟著幾名動作詭異的機械兵士。有人擔心那可能是 Garlean 帝國的新型兵器，事情嚴重到連 Garlond Ironworks 都被請來協助調查。身為記者，她立刻嗅出了一篇「一定會大賣」的特稿題材，決定要搶在所有人之前把真相寫出來，只是這需要像你這樣的冒險者提供第一手情報。她說，黑色載具最近一次被目擊，是在中央 Thanalan 的 Black Brush 一帶，拜託你只要有任何發現，就務必儘快回來向她報告。</p>
<p>照著她提供的線索，你來到 Black Brush，很快就在路邊發現一台黑到發亮的汽車停在那裡，旁邊一位全身穿黑的年輕男子正費力地想把它推動。他一邊抱怨這台車怎麼樣都不肯動，一邊問這附近有沒有修車的地方；可當你提到 Thanalan 和 Eorzea 時，他卻一臉茫然，顯然從沒聽過這些地名。你於是提議，可以試著找 Garlond Ironworks 或 Cid 幫忙看看這種機械，他總算鬆了一口氣，先問了你的名字，接著自我介紹說自己叫 Noctis，可以叫他 Noct。你和他一起頂著車尾用力推，那台車被他稱作 Regalia，而他一邊出力一邊嘀咕說「這種場面真有既視感」。沒多久，一名 Ironworks 的技師發現了你們，一邊驚嘆這台車的造型，一邊飛奔去把他們的老闆叫來──同盟請來調查謎之載具的，就是那個熟悉的工程師 Cid。Cid 到場後，先看了看車體，判斷它的構造與 Garlean 的 magitek 完全不同，又確認這位年輕人就是車主。聽說 Noctis 根本不知道 Eorzea 是什麼地方之後，他便讓對方把整件事的來龍去脈說給他聽。Noctis 回想自己最後的記憶，是在 Niflheim Empire 的基地裡，遇到一台奇怪的機器，再睜開眼就出現在這個世界。他懷疑那可能是某種傳送裝置。Cid 一面思索，一面提起最近流言中的「機械士兵」──看起來像全身披甲的人類，手持高性能火器，行動卻精確得不自然。Noctis 一聽，立刻說那八成就是他世界裡的 magitek troopers，也就是俗稱的 MT，Niflheim Empire 製造出來的機械兵器。既然如此，Cid 便希望他能代替 Ironworks 調查這些士兵的真相；根據最新報告，他們最近出現在東邊 Unholy Heir 附近。如果能從 MT 身上找到回家的線索，那就再好不過了。Noctis 於是點頭答應，而 Cid 不放心讓一個來自異世界的客人獨自亂闖，轉頭拜託你陪 Noct 一起去，他自己則留下來照料 Regalia。</p>
<p>來到 The Clutch 附近時，你和 Noctis 很快就找到了傳聞中的目標：一整隊 MT 正在沙地上巡邏，背後還跟著一台龐大的 magitek armor。FATE 啟動，人影與槍火同時衝上前來，你們兩人也拔出武器迎戰，一波又一波將機械兵打得東倒西歪。最終，那台巨大的 magitek armor 也在你們的攻擊下爆出火花，拖著沉重的金屬身軀倒在地上。戰鬥結束後，Noctis 盯著滿地殘骸，神情複雜地說，這些兵器果然是跟他一起被拋到這個世界來的。但即使冒著生命危險把它們全部擊潰，卻還是沒能找到任何能讓他回去的線索。他有些煩躁地承認，接下來也不知道該怎麼辦，只能先回去請教 Cid，也順便看看 Regalia 的情況。他說那位老工程師看起來很有兩把刷子，於是邀你和他一同返回 Black Brush。</p>
<p>回到 Black Brush Station 之後，Cid 立刻上前詢問調查結果。得知你們不只找到了那些機械士兵，甚至還跟他們交戰過，他確認傳聞並非空穴來風，並表示很想親眼看看這種技術的構造。因此，他拜託你：如果之後再遇到這些機械兵，希望你能盡可能撿回一些零件交給 Ironworks 分析。旁邊的 Ironworks Hand 也補充說，你可以把那些零件交給他，或是交給三大城邦中的其他 Ironworks 成員，他們會在 Cid 處理完手邊一堆工作後，再把這些材料一併轉交給他。這時，Noctis 忍不住問起自己的車去哪了，Cid 便解釋說，剛剛有一位記者在附近四處打聽，他為了避免 Regalia 被圍觀，只好先把車挪到 Dispatch Yard 去，順便專心進行修理。他已經找到故障的原因，雖然製作替換零件還需要時間，但至少可以確定是修得好的。就在這時，Kipih Jakkya 的喊聲傳來，她氣喘吁吁地衝過來，興奮地說眼前這位一定就是傳聞中的「神祕男子」。她打量了 Noctis 一番，說自己雖然不是時尚專欄記者，但非常喜歡他這種簡潔卻注重細節的打扮，隨即再次以 The Raven 記者的身分正式自我介紹，確認他是不是那台神祕黑色載具的主人。Noctis 回答說，那台車叫作 Regalia，Kipih 一邊反覆念著這個名字，一邊稱讚這個名字很有氣質，接著便追問他來自哪裡、又是怎麼來到這裡的。Noctis 說自己來自遙遠的地方，原本正和同伴一起旅行，在戰鬥途中莫名其妙就到了這個世界，但無論如何，他都必須想辦法回去，因為還有太多未完成的事情。對 Kipih 來說，這簡直是教科書級的範例：來自異世界的神祕青年，拚命尋找回家的路。她將這樣的設定形容成「非常有前途的題材」，又問起他究竟是在進行怎樣的旅程。Noctis 於是坦白，他本來是和朋友們一起上路，要去見一位對自己而言非常重要的人。Kipih 一聽立刻精神一振，追問那位「重要的人」和他的關係究竟是什麼，Noctis 卻有些招架不住，提醒她自己也還有一堆問題等著解答。於是 Kipih 放緩語氣，提出交易：只要他願意接受 The Raven 的獨家專訪，她就會動用所有線人與人脈，幫忙找出他回家的線索。考慮了一下之後，Noctis 答應了這個提議，Kipih 便建議大家一起前往 Ul’dah，一邊移動一邊繼續訪談。Cid 則表示他會開始著手製作 Regalia 所需的替換零件，這段時間就交給他處理，你們可以先去忙自己的事情。</p>
<p>之後，在 Ul’dah 的 Emerald Avenue，方才的訪談告一段落，Noctis 伸了個懶腰，無奈地說那根本不是訪問，而是審問。反觀 Kipih，則是顯得相當滿意，說 Noctis 非常配合，讓她為這篇專題文章收集到了不少「多汁的內幕」。她透露，Noctis 原本是和朋友一起旅行，要去見自己心愛的未婚妻，並笑說這種跨越世界的戀人故事，下一期的 The Raven 一定會賣翻。但她很快注意到你有點無言的表情，於是趕緊補充，自己雖然很久沒有登上頭版，卻不是只把這當成一樁有趣的新聞。她已經答應要幫 Noctis 找回家的路，這一點絕對不會忘記。她說自己已經先把消息放給各地的記者同伴和線人，相信隨時都會有新情報傳來。正說著，聯絡果然打了進來，她聽完報告後由衷道謝，隨即轉身對你們露出充滿期待的眼神。Kipih 告訴你們，現在總算出現了一條有希望的線索，接下來就輪到三個人一起出發去確認真相。她要你和 Noctis 先好好準備一番，等整裝完畢後再來找她，下一段旅程就此展開。</p>

<p><b>在暗夜中現身之人 (15:03–28:11)</b></p>
<p>結束在 Ul’dah 的那場「訪談」之後，Noctis 長長吐了一口氣，抱怨說那根本不是 interview，而是 interrogation。Kipih Jakkya 卻已經把注意力轉向下一條線索──據說在 Twelveswood 裡面，也有人看見過那種 mechanical soldiers。她的同事目前只聽到零星的傳聞，因此她建議，真正要追查的第一步，還是得先到 Gridania 去找目擊者打聽詳情。只是，Noctis 初來乍到，對 Eorzea 的地理完全不熟，要他自己在森林裡亂闖，八成會直接迷路。於是她微笑著表示，願意親自送他一程到 Gridania，Noctis 也爽快地答應，讓她帶路。你們就這樣往 Black Shroud 而去。抵達 New Gridania 之後，你發現 Noctis 正待在 The Knot 的攤位旁邊，一臉心虛地解釋說自己沒有偷懶，只是隨便看看這裡的衣服。他很顯然被這個城市特有的布料與剪裁吸引，認真地端詳著每一件陌生的服飾。</p>
<p>接著，你們一行人在 Gridania 四處分頭打聽關於 mechanical soldiers 的謠言。在 Old Gridania 的 Rosewood Stalls，Hadrefort 對這種傳聞完全不太清楚，倒是他的弟弟 Marcquelort 把自己聽來的消息說了出來──有個熟人聲稱，在 East Shroud 的 Hawthorne Hut 旁邊遇見過那種士兵。那人原本以為對方只是普通的人類，結果仔細一看，反而更像是被做成「人偶」的東西。Hadrefort 聽了以後立刻不滿地數落弟弟，說這麼重要的情報竟然不早點講，如果哪天自己被這種怪物幹掉，那筆帳就算在弟弟頭上。在另一頭的 Wailing Barracks，Mitainie 則告訴你，駐守 Amarissaix’s Spire 的哨兵在巡邏 Bramble Patch 時，也回報過類似的遭遇。那名哨兵一開始以為自己看到的是立在田裡的 scarecrows，結果走近一看，那些「稻草人」居然突然動了起來，直接撲上來攻擊。他們因此懷疑，那可能是某種前所未見的 imperial weapon，目前仍在討論應對的方式。至於守在 White Wolf Gate 的 Roustebant 則證實，機械士兵的確曾在 East Shroud 被人看見，雖然他本人不清楚細節，但整個 Twelveswood 的 Wood Wailers 都已經處於高度警戒狀態。途中，你們又回到 Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre 時，只見 Noctis 瞪大眼睛看著四周一個個 Miqo’te，忍不住小聲念著「Cat-people…cat-people everywhere」，承認 Y’jhimei 之前說的完全不是誇張。等所有人再次集中之後，Kipih 立刻追問你是不是打聽到了什麼。無論你說的是 Hawthorne Hut 附近的目擊談，還是 Bramble Patch 一帶的突襲事件，她最後都得出同樣的結論：只要在 Bramble Patch 盯著看，遲早會等到那批機械兵出現。Noctis 聽完後興致勃勃，二話不說就往森林裡衝，Kipih 來不及把 Twelveswood 那錯綜複雜的路況說完，他的身影已經消失在樹影之間。她只好轉頭拜託你快點追上去，不然這位異世界來的旅人真的有可能在林子裡迷路。</p>
<p>在 East Shroud 的 Bramble Patch，你總算追上了 Noctis。他環顧四周，確定這裡就是傳聞中的地點，只是暫時什麼都沒出現，只能乖乖「等看看」了。森林一度安靜得只剩下風聲和樹葉摩擦的細響。就在這時，一陣不祥的聲音從遠處傳來，Noctis 立刻抬頭，叫你一起去查看。你們循著聲音方向跑去，穿過樹叢之後，見到的卻不是 mechanical soldiers，而是一頭陌生又駭人的怪物──一隻來自他世界的 daemon。Noctis 一眼就認出了這種東西，皺著眉說，這種怪物絕對不能放著不管。Duty 啟動，你們兩人毫不猶豫衝上前去。戰鬥中，他不斷提醒你這可不是普通小怪，還一再注意你腳邊出現的奇怪 pillars，叫你千萬別忽視。當能量在柱子周圍聚集時，他會大喊那東西絕對不能放著，必須想辦法處理掉，甚至在兩根 pillar 同時出現時，直接分配任務，要你各自負責一邊。daemon 的攻擊步步緊逼，但你們一面拆掉這些機關，一面抓準時機反擊，最後終於把這頭怪物打倒在地，Duty 也隨之宣告完成。</p>
<p>戰後，Noctis 站在逐漸散去的塵埃之中，低聲嘀咕著「先是 magitek troopers，現在又來 daemon，這世界到底發生什麼事了」。他無法想像，到底是什麼力量把這些東西統統扯過了世界的邊界。你看他氣力放盡，便提議先休息一下，他也坦承自己確實需要喘口氣，乾脆就地紮營。很快地，兩人就在森林樹蔭下搭起簡單的 camp，火光在黑暗中搖曳。Noctis 望著火焰，忽然把話題轉向你，想知道你為什麼會一直這樣到處奔走、冒著危險做這些事。當你回答說，自己的目的就是為了保護身邊重要的人，他露出一絲會心的笑容，說如果是這樣，你大概會跟 Gladio 很合得來──那個大塊頭總是隨時準備替大家擋下所有危險。Noctis 回想起自己和 Gladio 以及其他夥伴一起旅行的日子，說你的回答讓他不禁想起了那些同伴。至於他自己的目的，他想了想，最後只選了一句最貼近內心的形容：那就是「守住一個約定」。然而，被困在這個世界的現在，他根本無法履行那個約定。看著營火的光芒，他再次默默對自己說，無論如何，他都得回到自己的世界去……一定要想出辦法。</p>
<p>回到 Old Gridania 的 Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre 之後，Noctis 說，雖然能把那隻 daemon 解決掉是好事，但這次依然沒有找到任何回去的線索，只換來更多的問號。Kipih 問他這趟調查有沒有得到想要的答案，他苦笑著說，得到的只有「更多問題」，像是 daemon 又是怎麼跑來 Eorzea 的。她好奇 daemon 到底是什麼，Noctis 解釋那是一種自己世界裡的怪物。Kipih 想了想，說自己雖然不是自然學者，但聽起來有點像這邊人們口中的 voidsent，那種會從另一邊爬過來的東西。她順勢抓住這個比喻，反過來鼓勵 Noctis：既然連那樣的怪物都能莫名其妙跑到這個世界，那麼你要找到回去的路，也不見得是做不到的事。Noctis 只能輕聲回了一句「希望如此吧」。Kipih 表示，她會繼續和同事們一起追查新的線索，叫你們暫時先「稍微等一下」。只是 Noctis 不太想乖乖待著，他說自己反而想出去繞一繞，看看這附近的環境，問這樣是否可以。Kipih 想了想，認為只要他別離城市太遠，應該不會有大問題，便勉強點頭答應；結果話還沒說完，人就又已經走遠了。她只好嘆了口氣，轉頭拜託你陪在 Noctis 身邊，說雖然不至於擔心他會突然消失，但知道他不是一個人，她心裡也比較踏實一點。同時，Kipih 也向你保證自己不會空手而回，等你們再回來時，手上一定會有新的情報可以分享。之後，你在 New Gridania 的 The Knot 再次找到 Noctis，他隨意地打了聲招呼，要你回去跟 Kipih 說不用太擔心，他有能力照顧自己，也沒有打算一聲不吭就消失。他只是剛好在這個攤販前逛逛衣服，結果邊看邊聊的時候，老闆乾脆直接送了他幾件。Maisenta 說，你這位朋友不但身材好、氣質也很適合這裡的衣服，讓這樣的年輕人穿著自家商品走在街上，就是最好的廣告。Noctis 有點不好意思地道謝，接著又轉向你，說他還想再多逛逛這座城市，如果你沒別的事，就陪他一起四處走走吧。</p>

<p><b>乘風而來的信使 (28:13–)</b></p>
<p>Noctis 回想一路走來的經過，坦承自己到現在依然完全不知道要怎麼回到原本的世界。眼下能做的事情，大概也只有等待 Kipih Jakkya 挖出新的線索而已，他苦笑著這麼說，卻也知道一直悶著頭煩惱下去只會越來越焦躁。既然難得來到這麼遙遠又美麗的地方，他決定至少要替自己和夥伴們留下幾段好好記住的回憶。於是他說，其實自己看起來雖然不像，但非常迷釣魚，只要有時間就會跑去甩竿，現在剛好有的是時間，不如就趁這個機會去附近的釣場走走，順便邀你一起去。你們就這樣前往中央森林的 Jadeite Thick，在河岸邊和 Noctis 會合。看來他早就先開釣一輪，得意洋洋地說自己已經釣起來超過十條魚。就算如此，他還是坦白承認，內心深處充滿了不安──如果一直找不到回去的路，到底該怎麼辦？這種念頭每次浮上心頭，他的心情就會不由自主地沉下去。可是在這樣安靜的森林裡，專心把目光放在水面上，一次又一次丟出魚線、回收魚鈎的節奏，反而能讓他的思緒慢慢沉澱，重新集中在「該做的事情」上。他說，在自己的世界裡，有一群人正在等他回去，他必須回應那些期待；而現在，他也把希望的一部分寄託在你身上。沒多久，他注意到旁邊那座巨大的水車，提議說既然都來了，不如拍張照片當作紀念。你答應之後，他把構圖調整好，笑著說要把這一刻好好記錄下來。快門按下，照片成形，他看著畫面忍不住笑出聲來，說彷彿都能聽見 Prompto 在旁邊大喊「這個光線太完美了！」他說，等回到自己的世界，一定要把這張照片拿給那些傢伙看，說到這裡便建議差不多該回去了。</p>
<p>回到 Old Gridania 的 Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre 時，Kipih Jakkya 匆匆忙忙跑過來，看到你們毫髮無傷地出現，終於鬆了口氣。Noctis 問她發生了什麼事，她解釋說，剛剛從一位同事那裡得到了新的情報──那些機械兵現在出現在 Ixali 的領地裡。單就這點來說也許只是入侵事件，但被打擾的 Ixali 顯然非常不安，於是召喚出了他們的守護神 Garuda。如果只是一般人聽見這個名字，多半會嚇得臉色發白，Noctis 卻只是輕描淡寫地說「那個 bird lady 嗎？感覺好像在哪裡打過類似的傢伙」，態度自然得像是在聊日常。Kipih 聽完瞪大雙眼，驚訝地發現他和你一樣，都是那種曾經親手打倒過強大存在的「primal-slayer」。Noctis 對 primal 這個詞不太熟悉，問這是不是有點像他世界裡說的 Astral 或 Messenger，但隨即自己搖頭說細節就先別管了，總之就是某種不得不出手處理的存在。Kipih 說 Garuda 現在在她北邊的領域 Howling Eye，那裡風勢強到幾乎不可能靠步行接近。如果你們真的打算和她對峙，她會聯絡 Garlond Ironworks 借一艘飛空艇，這段運補的事情就交給她去處理，請你們趁這段時間把準備工作做足，等準備完就到 Carline Canopy 前面會合。Noctis 則在這時候正式說，你已經用行動證明自己值得信賴，既然要一起對付 Garuda，他就把自己擁有的「power of kings」分一部分借給你。那種力量能讓你像他一樣在戰場上瞬間移動、從遠處一口氣衝到敵人面前。他說，剛開始可能會有點不習慣，但以你的身手，很快就能掌握那種節奏。想到這一切都是 magitek troopers 惹出來的風波，他覺得自己也有責任把事情收拾乾淨。之後，在 New Gridania，他說自己隨時都能出發，而 Kipih 則回報說飛空艇已經準備就緒，只等你們點頭就會立刻起飛。你表示準備完畢後，她當機立斷地帶著你們踏上前往戰場的航程。</p>
<p>飛空艇在 Twelveswood 上空疾馳，很快便抵達 Howling Eye。地面上已經是一片混亂，Ixal 四處奔逃，有人大喊「要命的趕快跑」，有人說眼前那個身影雖然看起來很像他們的女神，卻又感覺完全不是同一個存在，還有人乾脆說不管她是誰，總之得先逃命要緊。風之聖域的中心，一個看似 Garuda 卻又裹著陌生力量的存在懸浮在空中，用你聽不懂的語言說話，可是那聲音透過 Echo 清楚傳進你的耳裡。她一邊打量這些吵鬧的召喚者，一邊困惑於自己被帶到這個見所未見的土地上。很快地，她的視線落在 Noctis 身上，稱呼他為「Chosen King」，彷彿早就知道他是誰。她說，正是他的存在，把自己從另一個世界牽引到這裡來。如果他是為了力量而來，那就拿起武器，用戰鬥來證明自己是否值得獲得那份力量。Duty 再次啟動，Noctis 抬頭看向你，說是時候實戰使用剛才借給你的力量了。戰鬥打響，他一邊鼓勵你不要緊張，一邊要你配合他在戰場上畫出規律的走位軌跡。你用特別的 duty action「Warp-strike」從遠處一躍而上，他則提醒你們的攻擊必須「同時命中才有意義」，不斷要求你抓準timing。每次配合成功，他就笑著說「這才像樣」，要你就照這樣繼續打下去。等到 Garuda 開始聚集力量準備大招時，他會先警告你快退，再立刻補一句「跑是不夠快的」，要你直接 warp 到附近的 pillar 上躲避。就算在壓力最大的瞬間，他也會主動衝到你前面說「這裡交給我」，幫你擋下那一波攻勢。就這樣，你們在暴風之中一步一步逆轉局勢，最終將那股力量擊潰，戰鬥宣告結束。</p>
<p>風暴平息後，Noctis 真心稱讚你的實力，說你打得比想像中更兇猛。方才還是敵人的 Garuda 之類的存在再次開口，透過 Echo 說自己已經看清楚了 Crystal 的選擇，承認 Noctis 和你都具備這份力量的資格。Noctis 嘆口氣說，這種神明總是喜歡先把人丟進試煉裡磨一磨，懷疑到好像全世界都會毀滅一樣。她則冷靜回答說，他們的力量一旦錯給不適合的人，付出代價的就是整個世界，所以試煉從一開始就不可能省略。就在這時，Cid 趕到現場，先為自己來遲道歉，再說他終於把 Regalia 修好，雖然理解那台車的構造花了不少時間，但現在可以放心說已經恢復如新。Noctis 聽了非常開心，坦白說這份人情實在太大，自己根本不知道該怎麼還。那位類 Garuda 的存在又把話題拉回到 Noctis 身上，直接叫出他的名字，說在他故鄉 Eos，那邊還有許多事情等著他去完成，而現在身處這個世界的他，就像是一枚錨，把兩個世界暫時固定在同一條線上。趁著這個機會，她願意為他打開通往原本世界的大門，但那道門撐不了太久，絕不能猶豫不決。Noctis 簡短道謝，又忍不住抱怨這些神明真是難以理解，前一刻還要取人性命，下一刻又出手幫忙，語氣卻已經柔和許多。最後，他面向你，說跟你一起在這個世界繞了一圈，其實過得很開心。無論你回他的是「改天再一起玩吧」還是「要好好把那邊的事情完成」，他都會露出笑容，說「那就這麼約定好了」。他說，自己還有一個一定要守住的約定，時間差不多了，必須動身。於是他轉身走向那道光之門，沒有任何猶豫地踏了進去，身影消失在世界與世界的縫隙之中。</p>
<p>光芒逐漸消退，你和 Cid 回到 New Gridania。Kipih Jakkya 說，就在 Noctis 走進光門之前，她彷彿看見門裡站著一位全身雪白的女子，氣質溫柔而遙遠，像是在那裡等他、引導他邁向前方。Cid 也點頭說自己看到了同樣的景象，那個人看起來就像是一直在等待 Noctis 回去的人，兩人之間一定有很深的牽絆。Kipih 忍不住猜，那會不會是他一直掛在嘴上的未婚妻；Cid 則說也許是，也許不是，真正知道答案的人已經走進光裡，留在這邊的人再怎麼猜也不會知道真相。不管那位女子如今身在何處，Kipih 都真心希望 Noctis 能順利和她重逢。她說，趁著一切還歷歷在目，得趕快回辦公室把這整件事寫成一篇精彩的特稿，並向 Cid 道謝，接著轉向你，誠懇感謝你一路上的幫忙。如果沒有你的協助，Noctis 不一定能這麼順利找到回去的路，而她的報導也不一定能畫下這麼漂亮的句點。她笑著要你到時候記得買一份 The Raven 來看，說完就匆匆離開。等她消失在街角，Cid 低頭沉吟，說 Noctis 真是一個很奇妙的年輕人，到最後也沒弄清楚他究竟是怎麼被捲進這場跨越世界的騷動。不過，既然那位風之存在說 Eos 還有許多事情等著他去完成，那這些在 Eorzea 經歷的一切，大概也會成為他必須跨越的試煉之一。最後，Cid 轉身拍了拍你的肩膀，說至少這邊的事情已經告一段落了，接下來只希望不論 Noctis 的旅程有多漫長，他都能一直走在 Crystal 的光芒之下。</p>
