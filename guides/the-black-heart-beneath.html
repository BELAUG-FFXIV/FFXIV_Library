<p>You meet Shigure once more in Kugane, where he greets you politely and asks if your adventures have been kind to you. His own have not borne fruit: his search for the Soboro Sukehiro and the fugitive Yojimbo continues with no progress to speak of. Before you can reply, Hildibrand bursts onto the scene, calling out to his “bald man” and remarking that he hoped to find him inside, only to discover him outside with his “stalwart assistant”─you. Shigure bristles at the “bald” remark, but has no chance to retort before Hildibrand explains that, having failed to uncover any useful leads, he and Nashu were on the verge of reconsidering their entire investigative strategy. He asks if Shigure has any word of “Jim” and the missing sword. Shigure blinks in confusion at the unfamiliar name, then realizes Hildibrand means Yojimbo, and admits that he has made no progress since you last spoke. Nashu studies Shigure’s expression and decides he looks troubled. If he still pines for his lost hair, she declares, he need pine no longer: she produces a miraculous hair tonic and presses it into his hands. Shigure is caught off guard, but touched by the gesture, and agrees to try it soon.</p>
<p>Before he can do so, a familiar undead voice rings out. The Gentle Dead Man approaches, delighted to find Master Zombibrand and his close companions yet again, and thanks the kindly kami for allowing such a reunion. Hildibrand is pleased to see “a man of the old horde,” but wonders why he still lingers in the Far East when he had been bound for Eorzea. The Gentle Dead Man explains that he had indeed intended to return and rejoin his brothers, and to that end had sought a fisherman willing to take him home. From that man, however, he heard a fascinating rumor: a funa yūrei, a Far Eastern variety of undead, had been seen wandering an island’s shore. His previous attempts to recruit zombies had failed, so he thought to broaden his criteria and seek out this ghost in the spirit of undead camaraderie. Sadly, the spirit has proved elusive. Shy, perhaps. He has tried to learn more by questioning the people of Kugane, but his efforts have borne no fruit. Hildibrand listens, then abruptly asks if, in the course of these inquiries, the Gentle Dead Man has heard mention of “Jim.” The undead emissary admits he knows nothing of such a Far Eastern spirit and confides that not everyone is willing to entertain his company, likely due to his undead nature. Hildibrand laments that prejudice against “the living impaired” persists in the world, and when the Gentle Dead Man offers to aid your search, Shigure suggests that he change into less conspicuous clothing, as his current wolfish attire resembles a certain fugitive who recently terrorized the city. Horrified at the oversight, the Gentle Dead Man hurries off to change, and Hildibrand proposes that everyone split up and make inquiries in Kugane once more.</p>
<p>You head out into the city and speak with various townsfolk. On the piers, Tsurubami notes that even the Sekiseigumi have been asking after a man named Yojimbo, but claims to have never heard of him. Even if she did know something, she says, she is not sure she would tell them. She speaks instead of the Kugane Wolf Burglar, now locked away and, according to rumor, facing horrific punishments for his supposed crimes. To her, this is madness. Every one of his “victims” was a notorious scoundrel, a greedy merchant with no scruples. Everything he stole, he gave to the poor. To call such a man a villain is foolishness, she insists, and since she recalls seeing you in the company of the Sekiseigumi, she begs you to make them see reason and show him mercy. In another quarter, Keisetsu remembers that the Lupin once asked after Yojimbo, but explains that the Lupin has since been detained. He cannot imagine why. When his mother fell ill, the Lupin gave him money for medicine unprompted; Keisetsu cannot reconcile that kindness with the accusations he hears. Elsewhere, Byakudan at the teahouse observes that the Sekiseigumi are desperate to find Yojimbo, but doubts they will gain much cooperation now. The Wolf Burglar has been arrested, and among the common folk he is no demon, but a hero to the downtrodden. Byakudan hints that the Sekiseigumi ought to scrutinize certain merchants instead─Akebono in particular─and warns that, in protest over the burglar’s treatment, many citizens now refuse to assist the authorities or anyone they suspect of working with them. Reluctantly, he turns you away as well.</p>
<p>Later, you regroup with Shigure in Matsuba Square. He asks what you have learned, and you tell him that there is little new information on Yojimbo, but that a certain Lupin is far better loved than he ever imagined. Shigure listens in mounting surprise as you relay the remarks you heard: a hero to the poor, a thief who shared his spoils with the needy, a man whose “victims” were despised by all. He did not expect the Wolf Burglar to weigh so heavily on the city’s conscience. Still, he reminds himself and you that the law is the law. Even disreputable merchants are entitled to fair treatment; to ignore their plight is to let the mob decide who lives and dies. At the same time, he cannot deny that the people’s refusal to share information out of protest is a serious concern. As a man of the Sekiseigumi, he feels deeply conflicted. Hildibrand, noting the tension, gently suggests that Shigure adopt less conspicuous clothing for the time being. Shigure grudgingly admits that the idea is sound and considers using his old kimono, though his face is already known and any attempt at disguise might be resented as deception. Nashu suddenly proposes another path: why not ask the Wolf Burglar himself? If he is so beloved by the people, there is no telling what secrets they may have confided in him. Shigure hesitates at the thought of relying on the prisoner, but concedes that if both he and Yojimbo were after the Soboro Sukehiro, they may share some connection. Hildibrand praises Nashu for arriving at the same conclusion he claims to have been moments away from, and Shigure resolves to speak with the Wolf Burglar without delay.</p>
<p>Together, you accompany Shigure to the gaol. He greets the Sekiseigumi turnkey politely and explains that, in order to ascertain the whereabouts of the fugitive Yojimbo, he wishes to question the Kugane Wolf Burglar. The turnkey readily agrees to escort you. Inside, Shigure addresses the Lupin and states the situation plainly: after the burglar’s arrest, the ronin Yojimbo absconded with the Soboro Sukehiro stolen from Master Akebono and remains at large. The sword seems to have been his objective from the start. Since the Wolf Burglar also coveted it, Shigure hopes he might know something of this man and his motives. The prisoner acknowledges that everyone knows the sword is worth a fortune, but points out that finding a buyer for such a famous blade, once word of the theft has spread, would be nearly impossible. Whoever stole it would need to rely on certain disreputable contacts─the sort of people the Wolf Burglar knows all too well. He offers to introduce you to them…once he is set free. Shigure is appalled and refuses outright. The burglar shrugs and says there is nothing more to discuss, urging you to leave. Hildibrand counsels a more open mind: if the good people of Kugane trust the burglar’s intentions, perhaps you should as well. Shigure grudgingly accepts that many have vouched for his character, and that if the tales are true, it would be wrong to see him hanged. He decides to petition his superiors for a temporary release into your custody for investigative purposes, with the promise of leniency should the burglar keep his word. The Lupin agrees to this bargain, but Shigure worries that the deliberations will take too long, or worse, be denied. At that, Hildibrand quietly asks Nashu if she has the hair tonic on hand and suggests that there is no better time to use it.</p>
<p>Right there in the gaol, Shigure reluctantly agrees to try the tonic. At Hildibrand’s urging, he empties the entire bottle over his head until not a drop remains. A strange sensation courses through his scalp, then builds into something overwhelming. A blinding light erupts. Outside the cell, the turnkey rushes over, shouting Shigure’s name and demanding to know what just happened. The Wolf Burglar, now freed in the confusion, is spirited out by Hildibrand and the others, while Shigure scrambles to contain the situation. He hastily apologizes and claims that one of his associates was carrying small explosives, one of which detonated unexpectedly. Naturally, he immediately ordered her to take the rest outside for everyone’s safety. Surely that explains the light, he insists, before excusing himself. The turnkey, dazed, tentatively accepts the explanation, only to wonder aloud when Shigure managed to regrow his hair. Outside, Shigure marvels that you escaped undetected at all and can only pray that your ruse holds. The Wolf Burglar leads the others into the waterways beneath Kugane, urging you to follow.</p>
<p>In the dim underground, the Wolf Burglar asks if you have been there before and warns that, if so, you may already have met his “friends.” They are a contemptible lot by polite standards, he says: Kugane’s castoffs, the people the city has no place for. If anyone has heard a whisper of Yojimbo, it will be them. He leads you into their midst, where Koju, one of their number, greets him with a mocking remark about “rat bastards” that the Lupin cheerfully throws back. Koju demands to know how he slipped the Sekiseigumi’s noose. The burglar smiles and credits his looks and silver tongue, then waves away the subject and asks for information instead. Koju eyes you and Shigure suspiciously and asks if the Sekiseigumi at his shoulder are the real ones with questions. The Wolf Burglar asks him not to give the young man a hard time, insisting that Shigure did right by him and that he intends to return the favor. Koju is stunned that the burglar would help a Sekiseigumi man, but the Lupin brushes off his concerns and asks only for cooperation, promising to leave once you have what you need. He explains that most of these people once tried to live honest lives─some even hoped to join the Sekiseigumi, like Shigure─but were turned away and left with no respectable options. When honest work is closed to you, he says, only dangerous, disreputable work remains. Someone must do it, and so these “industrious souls” have taken it up. They may not be the company you would choose, but while you are among them, he asks you to behave with basic civility. Shigure clears his throat and says he believes he has done so, and apologizes if he has given offense. The Wolf Burglar laughs and declares that you are all fast friends now, then finally asks if anyone has heard of a man called Yojimbo.</p>
<p>Koju frowns and admits that the name does not ring a bell, so he calls out to the others. No one knows the man. If he carried a bounty, Koju muses, that would be different. He casually asks what crime Yojimbo committed─did he perhaps offend the bugyō in some ridiculous way? The Wolf Burglar reveals the truth: Yojimbo stole the Soboro Sukehiro. Koju whistles in appreciation at such a prize and wonders about the motive. Even on the black market, finding a buyer for such a famous sword would be a nightmare. If the thief had made any attempt to sell it, Koju’s network would have heard. Shigure, frustrated, laments that you have come all this way only to come up empty-handed. Koju urges him not to give up so quickly. Assuming Yojimbo did not steal the sword purely for sport, there are only two reasons to take it: to sell it or to keep it. If this is not about money, then Soboro Sukehiro is unlikely to be his first trophy─or his last. Hildibrand’s eyes light up. He announces that his keen inspector’s sense speaks of a thieving collector of swords, and that there can be no mistake. Koju shrugs and says that if the man is a collector, he will only want the very best. That means his next target could be something truly legendary─for example, the Ame-no-Murakumo. Shigure is stunned. He had always thought that sword to be a mere faerie tale and demands to know if it truly exists.</p>
<p>You confirm that you have seen the Ame-no-Murakumo with your own eyes, and explain that a giant kami once wielded it against you and your companions. Shigure can scarcely believe it and presses you for details, so you tell him where it happened: within the treasure vault of the Kojin of the Red. Koju nods thoughtfully. If a sword of that caliber is housed there, then your search should continue in the Ruby Sea. The Wolf Burglar agrees that this is your best lead, but before he can finish suggesting your next move, Hildibrand cuts in, declaring that there must be no further delay. You must all head to the Ruby Sea at once. The scene ends, and outside Koju’s hideout, Hildibrand urges everyone to make ready, while Nashu happily looks forward to the sun and surf. The Wolf Burglar remarks that his friends below are good-hearted people trying to make the best of the bad hand fate has dealt them, and Koju reiterates that, if your quarry seeks legendary blades, he could do far worse than the Ame-no-Murakumo. Shigure, still processing what you told him, is awed that the sword not only exists, but was brought to bear against you by a kami of unimaginable strength. He clears his throat and admits that, before he joins you, he must attend to one matter of “great import”─namely, Hildibrand’s advice about changing his garments. He resolves to meet you at the Ruby Price after changing out of his conspicuous uniform, and insists that you go on ahead.</p>

<p>クガネの街角で、あなたは再びシュギレと顔を合わせる。彼は丁重に挨拶し、あなたの冒険が無事であったことを願っていると告げる。一方で、自らの進捗は芳しくないと肩を落とす。ソボロスケヒロと浪人ヨウジンボウを追う捜索は続いているものの、前回あなたと別れてから一歩たりとも前に進めていないのだという。そのとき、突然ヒルディブランドが現れ、「禿頭の友よ」と相変わらず失礼な呼び方で声をかけてくる。彼は、シュギレが屋内にいるものと思っていたが、まさか自分の「頼もしき助手」であるあなたと一緒に外で会えるとはと上機嫌だ。シュギレは「禿頭」呼ばわりに思わずむっとするが、言い返す暇もなく話は続く。新たな有力情報はおろか、かすかな手がかりすら得られなかったため、捜査方針の見直しを図っていたところだと説明し、ついでに「ジム」──すなわちヨウジンボウ──やソボロスケヒロに関する進展がないか尋ねる。シュギレは一瞬誰のことか分からず戸惑うが、すぐにヨウジンボウのことだと気づき、先ほどあなたに話したとおり、前回の報告以降まったく成果がないと改めて認める。そんな彼の表情を見たナシュは、まだ髪を失ったことを引きずっているのではと察し、「驚異的な効果」を誇る育毛薬を取り出して差し出す。シュギレは不意を突かれつつも、その心遣いに素直に礼を述べ、いずれ試してみると約束する。</p>
<p>そこへ、どこか懐かしい声が響く。ジェントル・デッドマンが姿を現し、再びゾンビブランド様と仲間たちに会えたことを心から喜んでいると語る。ヒルディブランドは、久々に「古き軍勢」の戦友に会えたと歓迎しつつも、彼がエオルゼアへの帰還途上にあったはずなのに、なぜ未だ極東に留まっているのかと首をかしげる。亡者は、確かに兄弟たちのもとへ戻るつもりで漁師に船出を頼んだが、その男から実に興味深い噂話を聞かされたのだと説明する。とある島の浜辺に、船幽霊に似た不死者が現れたというのだ。これまで新たなゾンビ仲間を募る試みは失敗続きだったため、いっそ条件を緩めて、この船幽霊に声をかけてみようと考えたのだという。しかし、その存在はなかなか姿を現さない。人見知りなのかもしれないと苦笑しつつ、クガネの人々に話を聞いているものの、有力な情報は手に入っていないと肩を落とす。ヒルディブランドはこれを聞きながら、ふと思い立ったように、捜索の過程で「ジム」という名を耳にしなかったかと尋ねる。ジェントル・デッドマンは、極東の妖怪か何かかと思ったが、その名の不死者には心当たりがないと正直に答える。また、自分がアンデッドであるがゆえに、街の人々がなかなか打ち解けてくれない節もあると打ち明ける。ヒルディブランドは、「生きていない者」に対する偏見がいまだ残っている現実を嘆きつつ、ゾンビブランド様がお探しとあらば、自分も喜んで協力したいと申し出る亡者の言葉に耳を傾ける。これに対しシュギレは、その狼じみた装いが、つい最近まで街を騒がせていた「狼盗賊」とあまりに酷似しているため、人々が身構えてしまうのではないかと指摘し、別の服装に着替えた方がよいと助言する。ジェントル・デッドマンは、自分の不注意を恥じて慌てて姿を消し、ヒルディブランドは改めて、一行で手分けしてクガネの人々に再度聞き込みを行おうと提案する。</p>
<p>あなたは街へ繰り出し、数名の住民から話を聞く。桟橋では、ツルバミが先日も赤誠組の隊士がヨウジンボウを探していたと語り、自分はその名の男を知らないと答えたのだと教えてくれる。もし何か知っていたとしても、それを話すかどうかは分からない、とも付け加える。そして、自然と話題は「クガネのウルフ・バーグラー」へ移る。彼はすでに捕らえられ、今や「罪」に見合わぬ苛烈な刑罰を科されようとしているという噂が流れているらしい。ツルバミはそれを「狂気の沙汰」だと断じる。彼の「被害者」は、いずれも街で悪名高いろくでなしばかりであり、自らの利益しか考えない強欲な商人たちだと。盗んだ品はすべて貧しい者たちに分け与えていたのに、それでもなお悪党呼ばわりする者たちこそ愚かだと言い放つ。そして、あなたが赤誠組と行動を共にする姿を見た覚えがあるからこそ、仲間がいるならどうか思い直すよう説得してほしいと、ウルフ・バーグラーへの慈悲を懇願する。別の場所で出会ったケイセツは、ヨウジンボウという名に聞き覚えはあるが、その名を口にしていたのは、やはりあのルパン頭の男──クガネ・ウルフバーグラー──だったと話す。彼はすでに赤誠組に拘束されており、ケイセツにはどうしても犯罪者には思えないのだという。病に倒れた母のために薬代が必要だと漏らしたとき、頼みもしないのに小判を差し出してくれた男が悪人であるはずがないと、彼は信じて疑わない。さらに別の茶屋では、ビャクダンが、最近になって赤誠組がヨウジンボウについてしきりに尋ねてきたと明かす。だが、ウルフ・バーグラーが捕らえられた今、人々が赤誠組に協力するとは思えないとも言う。裕福な商人たちがどう言おうとも、彼は貧しき者たちの英雄であり、最も虐げられた者たちに分け前を与える存在だと、ビャクダンもまた擁護する。そして、赤誠組はむしろ狙われた商人たち、とりわけアケボノのような人物をもっと詳しく調べるべきだと示唆しつつ、今の状況では、彼らと繋がりがあると疑われるあなたの求めにも応じられないと丁重に断る。</p>
<p>やがて、あなたは松葉広場に戻り、シュギレと合流する。彼は、何か収穫はあったかと問いかける。あなたは、ヨウジンボウに関する新たな情報はほとんど得られなかったものの、クガネのルパンに対する人々の評判が予想以上に高いことを伝える。貧しく虐げられた者たちの英雄であり、奪った戦利品を惜しみなく分け与える男だという声に、シュギレは目を見開く。彼は、ウルフ・バーグラーの存在がこれほどまでに人々の胸に重くのしかかっているとは夢にも思わなかったのだ。それでも、彼は自らの胸中に言い聞かせるように、「法は法だ」と口にする。どれほど評判の悪い商人であっても、法の庇護を受ける権利はあり、その窮状を無視することは、群衆の感情に裁きを委ねるに等しいと。しかし同時に、人々が抗議の意思を示すために情報提供を拒むという現実も、赤誠組の一員として看過できない問題だと認める。ヒルディブランドは、張りつめた空気を和らげるように、当面はもう少し目立たない格好に変えるべきではないかと提案する。シュギレは不本意ながらもその意見を「意外とまともだ」と認め、古い着物に着替えることを考えるが、自分の顔はすでに街中に知れ渡っており、下手に変装すればかえって欺こうとしていると反感を買いかねないと不安を漏らす。そこでナシュが、ふと別の案を思いつく。「それなら、本人に聞いてみたらいいんじゃない？」と、牢に囚われたウルフ・バーグラーに話を聞こうと提案するのだ。もし彼が人々にこれほど愛されているなら、きっと多くの秘密を打ち明けられているはずだと。シュギレは一瞬言葉を失うが、ソボロスケヒロを狙っていたのが彼とヨウジンボウの両方であるなら、何らかの繋がりがあっても不思議ではないと考え直す。ヒルディブランドは、ナシュの名案を褒めつつ、「自分もあと一歩で同じ結論に辿り着くところだった」とちゃっかり口を挟み、一行はウルフ・バーグラーとの面会に向かうことを決める。</p>
<p>あなたはシュギレとともに拘置所へ向かう。彼は、そこを守る赤誠組の看守に丁重に挨拶し、逃亡中の浪人ヨウジンボウの行方を知るため、クガネ・ウルフバーグラーへの聞き取りを行いたいと申し出る。看守は、捜査に役立つのであればと快く案内役を引き受ける。牢の前に立ったシュギレは、ウルフ・バーグラーに向き直り、事の次第を説明する。君が捕らえられた後、浪人ヨウジンボウがアケボノから奪ったソボロスケヒロを持ち去り、今もなお行方知れずであること。その刀は最初からヨウジンボウの狙いであったと見られ、同じ獲物を追っていた君なら、男の素性や目的について何か知っているのではないかと問いかける。囚人は、ソボロスケヒロが法外な価値を持つ名刀であることは誰もが知っていると認めつつも、その名が広く知れ渡った後でそんな名刀を買おうとする者を探すのは至難の業だと指摘する。そんな代物を裁こうと思えば、それなりに「アレな連中」に頼らざるを得ず、自分はそうした筋に顔が利くのだとほくそ笑む。そして、「自分を自由の身にしてくれるなら、喜んで紹介しよう」と取引を持ちかける。シュギレは即座に却下し、「そんな条件は論外だ」と声を荒げる。ウルフ・バーグラーは肩をすくめ、「それなら話はここまでだ、さっさと帰りな」と突き放す。そこへヒルディブランドが割って入り、「クガネの人々がこれほど彼を信頼しているのなら、自分たちも少しは信じてみるべきではないか」と穏やかに諭す。シュギレは、多くの者が彼の人柄を証言していた事実を思い出し、もし噂どおりの人物であるなら、絞首台送りにするのは間違っているのかもしれないと逡巡する。そして、上官に働きかけ、捜査協力を条件とした一時的な預かりを提案することを約束する。約束を守れば情状酌量の余地もあるかもしれないと伝えると、ウルフ・バーグラーは「禿頭」の条件付きだが、その取引を飲むと言う。しかし、シュギレはすぐに現実に立ち返る。果たして上層部がこの提案を受け入れてくれるのか、そもそも審議に時間がかかり過ぎてしまうのではないかと頭を抱える。そこでヒルディブランドは、ふと何かを思い出したようにナシュに声をかけ、育毛薬を持っているか確認する。ナシュは「もちろん！」と胸を張り、「今こそ試すべきときよ」と微笑むのだった。</p>
<p>シュギレは牢屋の中という状況に戸惑いながらも、その場で育毛薬を試すことを受け入れる。ヒルディブランドは、「一滴残らず頭に浴びるのだ」と念を押し、シュギレは半信半疑のまま瓶を逆さにして頭皮に注ぎ込む。不思議な感覚が頭全体を駆け巡り、それが徐々に強烈な刺激へと変わっていく。次の瞬間、眩い光が牢内を満たす。外にいた看守が慌てて駆けつけ、シュギレの名を呼んで何が起きたのか問いただす。その混乱のさなか、ウルフ・バーグラーはヒルディブランドたちに連れ出され、姿を消す。シュギレはとっさに頭を下げ、「仲間のひとりが小型の爆薬を持ち歩いており、そのうちひとつが誤って爆発した」と説明する。当然すぐに残りの爆薬を外へ運び出すよう命じたため、もう危険はないとまくしたて、これで光の件は説明がつくはずだと一方的に締めくくって、その場を辞そうとする。看守は混乱しつつも、ひとまず納得したように頷くが、その直後、「そういえばシュギレはいつの間に髪が生えたのだろう」と首をひねるのだった。外に出たシュギレは、どうにか無事に牢を抜け出せたことに自分でも驚きつつ、この欺きがいつまで保つか、ただ祈るばかりだと吐露する。ウルフ・バーグラーは他の面々を地下水路へと案内し、「さあ、ついてきな」と合図を送る。</p>
<p>薄暗い地下水路で、ウルフ・バーグラーは、ここへ来るのは初めてかとあなたに尋ねる。もしそうでないなら、すでに自分の「仲間たち」と顔を合わせているかもしれないと告げる。彼は、上から見れば「軽蔑すべき連中」だが、実態はクガネの社会からこぼれ落ちた人々だと説明する。ヨウジンボウの噂を聞いている者がいるとすれば、ここにいる者たちのはずだと、あなたをその輪の中へと連れて行く。そこで彼を迎えたのは、コウジュと呼ばれる男だった。「ネズミ野郎のくせに元気そうじゃねえか」と軽口を叩くコウジュに、ウルフ・バーグラーも「ネズミと言うなら狼も似たようなもんだろ」と笑い返す。すぐにコウジュは真顔になり、どうやって赤誠組の縄を抜けたのか問い詰める。ウルフ・バーグラーは、自分の容姿と弁舌の妙のおかげだとおどけて返し、すぐに本題へと切り替えて情報提供を求める。コウジュは、彼の背後にいるシュギレを一瞥し、「質問しているのは、その赤誠組の若造の方じゃないのか」と探るように問う。ウルフ・バーグラーは、シュギレに辛く当たる必要はないと制し、彼は自分にとって正しいことをしてくれたからこそ、今度はこちらが恩を返す番だと断言する。コウジュは目を丸くして、「赤誠組の人間を助けるつもりか」と呆れるが、ウルフ・バーグラーは「たとえそうだとしても、あんたたちが気にすることじゃない」と軽く受け流し、協力さえしてくれればすぐに立ち去ると約束する。そのうえで、ここにいる連中の多くはかつて真っ当に生きようとし、なかにはシュギレのように赤誠組入りを志した者もいたが、様々な理由で門前払いを食らった者たちだと語る。正当な働き口が閉ざされた後に残るのは、「危険で、後ろ暗くて、汚れた」仕事ばかりだ。誰かがそれをやらねばならない以上、彼らは自ら手を汚す道を選んだのだと。上流の者が好んで付き合うような種類の人々ではないかもしれないが、ここにいる間だけは最低限の礼節を守ってほしいと頼む。シュギレは咳払いをし、自分では礼を失するような真似はしていないつもりだと述べ、もしそう見えていたのなら許してほしいと頭を下げる。ウルフ・バーグラーは満足げに、「ほら、これでみんな仲良しだ」と笑い、ようやく本題に入る。彼らが探しているのは「ヨウジンボウ」と名乗る男であると告げ、聞き覚えがないか尋ねる。</p>
<p>コウジュは眉間に皺を寄せ、その名には聞き覚えがないと首をかしげる。そこで周囲の者たちにも声をかけるが、誰からも心当たりは返ってこない。「懸賞金でもかかってりゃ話は別なんだがな」とぼやきつつ、「そいつはいったい何をやらかしたんだ？ 奉行の飯に小便でもひっかけたか？」と冗談めかして尋ねる。ウルフ・バーグラーは、ヨウジンボウが奪ったのはソボロスケヒロであると明かす。コウジュは「なんてこった」と舌を巻き、その価値の高さを認める一方で、動機に首をひねる。そんな名刀を盗んだところで、黒市に流すにしても買い手を探すのは至難の業だし、もし売りさばこうとしているなら、自分たちの耳に噂が届いているはずだと。シュギレは、ここまで来て何の成果も得られなかったことに苛立ち、「こんな遠回りをしておきながら、手ぶらで帰る羽目になるとは」と悔しさを滲ませる。コウジュは、まだ諦めるには早いと宥める。もしヨウジンボウが腕試しだけのために刀を盗んだのでないとすれば、目的は二つに一つ──売るか、自分のものとして手元に置くかだろうと。そして金目当てでないのなら、ソボロスケヒロは彼にとって最初の「戦利品」でも最後の一本でもないはずだと推理する。ヒルディブランドはそこで、「名探偵の勘が囁いている」と言い出し、「刀を集める盗人」が背後にいると高らかに宣言する。コウジュは肩をすくめつつも、「つまり『コレクター』ってわけだな」と納得し、そういう手合いなら最高級の刀にしか興味を示さないだろうと続ける。その場合、次に狙われるのは伝説級の名刀に違いない──たとえば、「アメノムラクモ」といったところかと口にする。シュギレはその名を聞き、「アメノムラクモだと？ そんなものは昔話に出てくる幻想の剣かと思っていた」と驚愕し、その伝説の太刀が実在するのかと問いただす。</p>
<p>あなたは、自分の目でアメノムラクモを見たことがあると告げる。かつて、とてつもない力を持つ神がその剣を振るい、あなたと仲間たちを切り伏せようとしたので、その一撃を受け止めねばならなかったのだと説明する。シュギレは信じられないといった様子でさらに問いを重ね、どこでそんな出来事が起こったのかを知りたがる。あなたは、紅玉海のコウジン族──The Red Kojin──が管理する宝物庫の中での戦いであったことを話す。コウジュは腕を組み、それならば捜索を続けるべき場所は紅玉海だと結論づける。あれほどの刀がその宝物庫に収められているのなら、伝説級の名刀を狙う者が目をつけないはずがないと。ウルフ・バーグラーも、最良の手がかりであることに同意し、今後の動きについて口を開こうとするが、その言葉を遮るようにヒルディブランドが一歩前に出る。「これ以上ぐずぐずしている暇はない。すぐにでも紅玉海へ向かうのだ！」と、いつもの調子で先陣を切る。場面が切り替わり、コウジュの隠れ家の外で、ヒルディブランドは皆に支度を促し、ナシュは「また紅玉海の太陽と波を満喫できる」と無邪気に笑う。ウルフ・バーグラーは、先ほど出会った地下の仲間たちについて、「運悪く真っ当な道を断たれただけで、本当は皆いい心を持っている」と静かに語る。コウジュも、「伝説の刀を狙うような奴にとって、アメノムラクモはこの上ない獲物だ」と改めて念を押す。シュギレは、アメノムラクモが実在するだけでなく、その剣が計り知れない力を持つ神に握られ、あなたたちに向けて振り下ろされた事実に圧倒されながらも、ひとつ咳払いをして気持ちを整える。そして、自分が紅玉海に向かう前に、「とても重大な」用事を片付けねばならないと宣言する。もっとも、「重大」と言うほどのものではないと照れ隠しをしつつ、「先ほどの衣服に関する助言についてだ」と言葉を足す。彼は、目立つ赤誠組の装束から古い着物へ着替えるため、一足先にクガネに残ることを決め、「自分はルビープライスで合流するから、先に行っていてくれ」とあなたたちに告げるのだった。</p>

    story:`<div class="clamp" data-collapsed="true">
<p>在 Kugane 的街角，你再次與 Shigure 相遇。他先向你致意，說你看起來氣色不錯，希望這一路的冒險沒有讓你太過疲憊。相較之下，他自己的進展就沒那麼光彩了──追查 Soboro Sukehiro 和浪人 Yojimbo 的行動至今仍毫無突破，和上次與你告別時相比，一點實質成果都沒有。這時，Hildibrand 突然闖入畫面，用一貫欠缺分寸的語氣，大聲叫著這位「光頭的男子」，說本以為會在室內找到他，沒想到竟在外面看見他，還正好和自己「最可靠的助手」──也就是你在一起。Shigure 被「光頭」兩個字戳得有些不悅，卻來不及反擊，只能聽 Hildibrand 繼續說下去。原來，他和 Nashu 一直在調查，卻連一點有用的線索都抓不到，甚至連勉強可以稱作「相關」的情報都沒有，因此正準備重新思考整體的調查方針。於是，他順口問起「Jim」和那把失蹤的刀是否有任何進展。Shigure 一開始聽不懂這個名字指的是誰，很快才反應過來 Hildibrand 說的是 Yojimbo，於是再度承認自從上回和你談過之後，確實沒有任何新消息。看到他愈說愈沮喪的模樣，Nashu 乾脆把話題轉開，說他看起來還是很在意自己失去的頭髮。如果真的這麼難受，那就不必再忍耐了──她從懷裡拿出一瓶宣稱效果「超乎常理」的育髮藥水，直接塞到他手中。Shigure 被這份心意弄得有些慌亂，卻也認真道謝，答應之後會找機會試用。</p>
<p>就在這時，一個熟悉的亡者嗓音響起。Gentle Dead Man 再次出現在眾人面前，真心感謝上天能讓他再次與 Master Zombibrand 和夥伴們重逢。Hildibrand 歡迎這位「古老軍勢」的同袍，也順口問起，上次不是說好要回到 Eorzea 和同伴們會合嗎，怎麼現在還滯留在 Far East。Gentle Dead Man 解釋，自己原本確實打算回去，為此還特地去找當地的 fisherman 商量回程的船票，結果卻在那裡聽到了一個實在太有趣的傳聞：據說有名為 funa yurei 的船幽靈，在某座島的海岸旁徘徊。他之前為了替 Gentle Dead Men 招募新同伴，努力尋找其他 undead，結果卻屢屢落空。既然如此，索性把標準放寬一點，試著與這種幽靈接觸，說不定也能成為「不死者同伴」。然而，這位船幽靈極度神出鬼沒，或者該說個性害羞，始終不願現身。他只好在 Kugane 四處打聽，卻始終問不到有用的線索。Hildibrand 聽著聽著，忽然想到什麼似的，問他在打聽的過程中，有沒有聽過一個叫「Jim」的名字。Gentle Dead Man 坦白說，自己完全不知道那是什麼樣的 Far Eastern spirit，而且老實說，並不是所有人都願意和他聊天，多半是因為他 undead 的身分。Hildibrand 聽了不勝唏噓，感嘆世上仍然有人對「不再活著的人」抱持偏見。當 Gentle Dead Man 表示，如果 Master Zombibrand 需要，他願意出力幫忙尋人時，Shigure 立刻提出建議：既然他想在城裡四處打聽，最好不要再穿這套狼模樣的衣服。那身裝扮和曾經把整座城市鬧得人心惶惶的 Wolf Burglar 實在太像了，很容易讓人誤會。Gentle Dead Man 對自己的疏忽深感震驚，立刻說要去換一套不那麼顯眼的衣服。待他匆匆離開後，Hildibrand 隨即宣布，大家不妨再次分頭行動，在 Kugane 的市民之間重新打聽線索。</p>
<p>你走上街頭，開始逐一詢問。Pier 2 一帶，Tsurubami 告訴你，Sekiseigumi 前幾天也來問過 Yojimbo 的事，但她真的沒聽過這個人。即便真的知道些什麼，她也不一定會願意說出口。話題很快轉到被關起來的 Kugane Wolf Burglar 身上。她說，現在流傳的消息指出，Sekiseigumi 打算以極其殘酷的刑罰來懲治這名「罪犯」，在她看來根本是瘋了。因為這名 burglar 口中所謂的「被害者」，全都是城裡人盡皆知的惡徒，從不顧別人死活的貪婪商人。他偷來的一切，全都被他送到了窮人手中。這樣的人被當成惡魔一般對待，實在荒謬。她還記得你曾經和 Sekiseigumi 的人一起行動，所以拜託你，如果和他們關係不錯，就請務必替 Wolf Burglar 說情，讓他有機會獲得寬恕。另一處的 Rakuza District 裡，Keisetsu 則說，Yojimbo 這個名字讓他想起來，曾經有一位 Lupin 打扮的男子向他打聽過同樣的事情。不過那已經是很久以前，現在那名 Lupin 早就被 Sekiseigumi 逮捕了。他實在無法想像對方到底犯了什麼罪，因為當他提到自己的母親生病、需要藥費時，那位 Lupin 甚至在他沒開口求助的情況下，就主動遞上了 koban。對他而言，這樣的男人怎麼也不像會做出惡行的人。你又前往 Umineko Teahouse，Byakudan 告訴你，不久之前 Sekiseigumi 也來問過 Yojimbo，而且態度顯得異常急切。但他也認為，在目前的情況下，他們很難得到任何幫助。因為現在整座城市的人都在議論──Wolf Burglar 已經被逮捕，而且在多數平民心中，他不是什麼該受最嚴厲懲罰的惡魔，反而是那些被壓在最底層的人心目中的英雄。Byakudan 認為，如果要查出真相，Sekiseigumi 更該好好調查這些被他「偷」過的 wealthy merchants，尤其是 Akebono 這一類在黑暗傳聞中心盤踞已久的人。也因此，許多人以抗議的方式拒絕配合當局，只要懷疑對方和 Sekiseigumi 有關，就乾脆閉口不談。基於同樣理由，他也婉拒向你提供更多幫助。</p>
<p>稍晚，你回到 Matsuba Square 與 Shigure 會合。他問你有沒有打聽到什麼，你如實告訴他：關於 Yojimbo 幾乎沒有新的線索，但城裡談起那位 Lupin 的人，卻都帶著意外地深厚情感。有人形容他是窮人與被壓迫者的英雄，有人說他只是把「辛苦得來」的戰利品全都送了出去，被偷的那些對象，反而才是徹底失去良心的惡徒。Shigure 一邊聽，一邊愈發吃驚。他沒想到 Wolf Burglar 的遭遇會如此深深烙在人們心中。即便如此，他仍然提醒自己，也提醒你，「法律就是法律」。就算那些 merchants 再怎麼不堪，只要案件被認定存在，他們就有權在法律下獲得公正對待。如果一味因為他們的名聲不好就放任不管，那就等於把生死交給情緒化的群眾決定。另一方面，人們為了抗議而選擇不提供情報，也確實讓局勢變得更加棘手。身為 Sekiseigumi 的一員，他對此感到深深的矛盾。Hildibrand 看出他的為難，提出一個實際但讓人難以反駁的建議：至少暫時換一身不那麼醒目的衣服。Shigure 雖然有些不甘，但也不得不承認這個主意出乎意料地合理，打算拿出以前的 kimono 穿上。不過，即使換了衣服，他的臉也早就被大家認得，就算偽裝成功，也可能被人視為刻意欺瞞，讓局面更糟。就在他猶豫不決的時候，Nashu 突然舉手說她有一個更簡單的辦法──既然 Wolf Burglar 在民眾之中如此受歡迎，何不直接去問他？說不定有不少人把秘密交給了這位「英雄」，而他正好知道你們想要的線索。Shigure 一時之間很難接受要去請教囚犯的主意，但當他想到 Soboro Sukehiro 同時成為 Yojimbo 和 Wolf Burglar 的目標時，也不得不承認兩人之間很可能存在某種關聯。Hildibrand 當場稱讚 Nashu 想法高明，還順便說自己也只差一步就會想到同樣的結論，於是你們便決定前往牢房與 Wolf Burglar 會面。</p>
<p>你跟著 Shigure 來到牢獄前。他禮貌地向守門的 Sekiseigumi Turnkey 打招呼，說明為了追查逃犯 Yojimbo 的下落，希望能和被關押的 Kugane Wolf Burglar 談一談。Turnkey 認為這有助於調查，便立刻同意帶你們進去。見到囚犯後，Shigure 直接說明情況：在 Wolf Burglar 被捕之後，那名浪人 Yojimbo 搶走了他從 Akebono 那裡偷來的 Soboro Sukehiro，然後就此消失。他們有理由相信，那把刀從一開始就是 Yojimbo 的真正目標。既然 Wolf Burglar 也對這把刀虎視眈眈，也許了解這名浪人和他的動機。Wolf Burglar 坦率地說，所有人都知道那是一把「價值連城」的名刀。但要替這樣一件廣為人知的寶物找到買家，可不是件容易事，尤其是在失竊消息傳得人盡皆知之後。想要出手，那個人勢必得尋求某些「不太光明」的管道，而他剛好和那樣的人脈十分熟悉。他願意替你們牽線──條件是現在就放他出去。Shigure 馬上拒絕，覺得這種要求根本不可能接受。Wolf Burglar 聳聳肩，說既然如此，那就沒什麼好談了，可以請你們離開了。Hildibrand 這時站出來，提醒 Shigure：既然 Kugane 的市民願意相信這名盜賊的善意，那他們是不是也該嘗試信任一下？Shigure 想起剛才聽見的種種評價，不得不承認有不少人願意替他作證。如果那些話都是真的，那就算依照法律，他也不該被輕率地送上絞刑架。他最後決定向上司提出建議，請求將 Wolf Burglar 以「協助調查」為由交給他們暫時看管。如果過程中他遵守約定，或許未來判決時也會得到一定程度的寬待。Wolf Burglar 很快答應這個交易，甚至順口又叫了他一聲「光頭」。然而 Shigure 很清楚，要讓上層買帳、完成各種審議，可能需要耗費不少時間，而且結果也未必會是他希望的。就在他苦惱之際，Hildibrand 悄悄轉頭問 Nashu：那瓶育髮藥還在身上嗎？Nashu 立刻回答：「當然有！」並笑著說，現在正是試用的好時機。</p>
<p>於是，Shigure 只好在牢房裡就地實驗這瓶神秘的藥水。他雖然有些猶豫，但在 Hildibrand 一再要求「一定要整瓶倒光」之下，只能閉上眼睛，將整瓶藥水毫不保留地倒在自己頭上。奇妙的感覺從頭皮延伸開來，很快轉變成強烈到難以忽視的刺痛。下一瞬間，整個牢房被耀眼的光芒淹沒。外頭的 Sekiseigumi Turnkey 聽到動靜，急忙跑來查看發生了什麼事。這段時間裡，Wolf Burglar 已經在 Hildibrand 一行人的掩護下溜出牢房，而 Shigure 則得在第一時間想出說辭。他連忙鞠躬道歉，說自己的同伴不小心攜帶了小型 explosive，其中一枚在牢內意外爆炸，所以才會有那道光。他當然已經立刻命令對方把剩下的炸藥全部帶到外面，為的是大家的安全，相信這樣就可以解釋剛才的一切。說完，他趕忙告退，Turnkey 雖然一臉困惑，但暫時接受了這個說法。等他回過神來，才驚覺 Shigure 不知何時已經長出一頭濃密的頭髮。來到外面後，Shigure 坦言完全不知道你們究竟是如何在不被識破的情況下逃出來的，只能祈禱這個荒唐的謊言不要太快被拆穿。此時 Wolf Burglar 已經帶著其他人前往城市下方的水路，邀請你一起跟上。</p>
<p>在陰暗潮濕的下水道深處，Wolf Burglar 問你是不是以前來過這裡。如果答案是肯定的，那你很可能已經見過他口中這些「朋友」。在地面上的人眼中，這些人也許是蔑視的對象，但在他看來，他們都是被整座城市棄之不顧的存在。如果這世界上有人知道 Yojimbo 的任何消息，那八成會是他們。他領著你走進一處隱蔽的空間，裡頭聚集著一群形形色色的男女，其中一名叫 Koju 的男人率先出聲，用半開玩笑的語氣問他：「你這隻狼怎麼會跑回這邊？還一副活得挺好的樣子。」Wolf Burglar 同樣以戲謔回應，兩人先簡短寒暄幾句，接著 Koju 立刻追問，他到底是怎麼從 Sekiseigumi 的繩索下逃脫的。Wolf Burglar 笑說，靠的當然是他俊俏的外表和靈巧的嘴巴，然後把話題一轉，說自己這次是為了情報而來。Koju 看了一眼你和 Shigure，懷疑真正想問問題的是那位穿著 Sekiseigumi 制服的年輕人。Wolf Burglar 請他不要刁難，強調 Shigure 確實在關鍵時刻做了對他有利的選擇，所以他現在也想回報這份人情。Koju 對於他居然要幫一個 Sekiseigumi 感到難以置信，但 Wolf Burglar 只說這些都是他自己的決定，對底下這些人沒有壞處，只要肯伸出援手，他們很快就會離開。接著，他解釋這裡的人其實多半都曾試著在「正道」上生存，有些甚至和 Shigure 一樣，希望加入 Sekiseigumi，卻因各種理由被拒之門外。當正當的工作都被擋在門外之後，只剩下那些危險、骯髒、名聲不佳的差事等著人去做。既然總得有人把這些事情扛起來，他們只好自己動手。也許這群人不是「上流人士」願意交往的對象，但在和他們共處的這段期間，他希望你們至少帶著基本的尊重。Shigure 聽完，先咳了一聲，說自己認為一直都有盡到禮數，如果有哪些地方讓人感到不快，也願意在此道歉。Wolf Burglar 覺得這樣就很好，笑著說大家已經是「好朋友」了，這才正式提起正題：他們正在尋找一個名叫 Yojimbo 的男人。</p>
<p>Koju 聽到這個名字先是皺眉，說完全沒印象，於是轉頭對其他伙伴大喊，問有人認識這個人嗎。結果整片地下空間安靜得出奇，沒有任何人回應。Koju 嘖了一聲，抱怨如果這人頭上掛著懸賞就好辦了，還順口問道：「他到底做了什麼？難不成往 bugyo 的飯碗裡撒尿？」Wolf Burglar 沒有接這句玩笑，只是冷靜地說，Yojimbo 把 Soboro Sukehiro 給偷走了。Koju 聽了先是讚嘆那把刀的美名，接著開始動腦分析。就算是透過 black market，要為這樣一把名刀找到買家也是極其困難的事。如果那個人真的在找買主，他們這些耳目很快就會聽到消息，然而到目前為止卻一片靜默。Shigure 為此感到沮喪，抱怨自己明明花了這麼大的功夫才跑來這裡，卻還是輸給了空手而回的結果。Koju 卻叫他不要那麼快就斷言失敗。如果 Yojimbo 偷刀不是為了挑戰自身技藝，只剩下兩個可能：要嘛是為了賣掉換錢，要嘛是打算自己收藏。既然現在看起來不像單純求財，那 Soboro Sukehiro 很可能既不是他的第一件戰利品，也不會是最後一件。Hildibrand 聽到這裡，雙眼一亮，說他的「名偵探直覺」已經嗡嗡作響，清楚地告訴他背後有個專門收集刀劍的盜賊，而且絕對錯不了。Koju 聳聳肩，表示聽起來也有道理。如果對方真的是 collector，那就只會挑最頂尖的名刀下手，下一個目標很可能會是傳說裡的武器──比如 Ame-no-Murakumo。Shigure 一聽這個名字，忍不住驚呼。他一直以為這只是 fairy tale 裡會出現的神話之劍，結果現在居然被當成可能的「下一個目標」。他連忙問對方這把傳說中的刀是否真的存在。</p>
<p>你選擇直接說實話：你親眼見過 Ame-no-Murakumo。曾經有一位擁有難以想像力量的 kami 揮舞著那把劍，毫不留情地試圖斬殺你和你的同伴，你甚至不得不正面接下那一擊。Shigure 聽完，震驚之餘還有更多疑問，於是你補充說，那場戰鬥發生在 Red Kojin 所看守的寶物庫深處。Koju 聽後點點頭，說既然這樣，那你們就應該回到 The Ruby Sea 繼續追查。像 Ame-no-Murakumo 這樣的劍，如果被收藏在那個寶物庫裡，對一個痴迷於名刀的 collector 來說，怎麼可能不去盯上它。Wolf Burglar 也認同這是目前為止最有希望的線索，打算接著提出下一步的策略，結果話還沒說完，就被 Hildibrand 抢先一步高聲打斷。「既然如此，就別再浪費時間了，現在立刻出發前往 Ruby Sea！」他一貫地搶著當先鋒，把整件事情定調為一場新的冒險起點。場景一轉，你們離開地下水路，Hildibrand 在地面上催促大家準備出發，Nashu 則興奮地表示迫不及待想再次在陽光與海浪中奔跑。Wolf Burglar 望著你們，輕聲說這些地下的同伴其實都是好人，只是被命運發了一副爛牌，才不得不走上這條路。Koju 則再一次提醒，如果你們追逐的是傳說級武器，那麼 Ame-no-Murakumo 絕對算得上頭號候選。Shigure 回想你剛才說過的話，還在消化這把刀不僅真實存在，而且還曾由一位力量難以想像的 kami 親手揮舞向你們這件事。過了好一會，他才清了清喉嚨，說在前往 Ruby Sea 之前，他還有一件「非常重要」的事情要處理。說是重要，實際上不過是剛剛 Inspector 提過的建議：換一套不那麼顯眼的 garments。他決定先回去換上過去那件舊 kimono，再到 Ruby Price 與你們會合，堅持要你們先行一步，不必為了他而耽擱行程。</p>
