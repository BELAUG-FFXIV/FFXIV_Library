<p>At the Ruby Price, you wait with Nashu, Hildibrand, and the Wolf Burglar for Shigure to arrive, the sea breeze tugging at your clothes as ships drift through the Ruby Sea. Nashu practically bounces on her heels, chattering about how she cannot wait to see Shigure’s “costume change.” The Wolf Burglar, meanwhile, eyes you sidelong and muses aloud how much a legendary blade might fetch on the open market, then protests your expression with a shrug—it is only an honest question, he claims. He suggests you all board the next ferry and meet Shigure here as arranged, and so you come. When at last a familiar figure appears on the docks, Hildibrand waves both arms and calls him over with all his usual enthusiasm. For a moment the Wolf Burglar stiffens, thinking he sees someone else, before realizing this is indeed Shigure in a completely different outfit. Shigure explains, a little embarrassed, that he was advised to wear something other than his Sekiseigumi uniform, so he visited Kogane Dori and bought clothes utterly unlike his usual garb. Hildibrand applauds the change as an improvement, Nashu gushes that she never knew he could be so fashionable, and Shigure turns red at the very idea. The Wolf Burglar snorts that he doubts those robes and zori will start any trends, but reminds everyone that you did not come here to talk fashion. If the collector is after the Ame-no-Murakumo, then your next destination must be the Isle of Zekki. Reaching it by air or through an underwater passage will be far trickier than expected. Shigure notes that the latter will be nearly impossible without the blessing of the Kojin, while the Wolf Burglar refuses to rely on his bird Montaro after the inspector’s previous antics. In the midst of this, Hildibrand turns to your lupin companion and, with disarming bluntness, points out that no one has yet heard his true motive for trying to take the Soboro Sukehiro from Master Akebono, especially when Koju said such a blade would be so difficult to sell.</p>
<p>The Wolf Burglar falls silent for a moment, then insists that it is not theft to reclaim what was stolen. He tells you of a humble samurai who lived a modest life, shunning luxury but never those in need. This man took in a young Lupin boy fleeing Doma during the occupation, treating him as a son. They shared few comforts beyond each other’s company, but their bond was strong. One day, a merchant came asking after the samurai’s sword and tried to entice him into selling his one treasured possession. Yet a sword is a samurai’s soul, and the man would sooner die than part with it, no matter the fortune offered. The merchant did not simply give up. He changed tactics, inserting himself into the samurai’s affairs, offering small sums of coin that gradually grew larger until the debt became a mountain. In the end, the samurai pledged his blade as collateral and labored day and night to repay what he owed. Though his spirit was unshaken, his body was frail. Illness took him before he could free himself, leaving his Lupin charge alone in a world that had taken everything from them. The Wolf Burglar says the boy later left Kugane and returned years after from Yanxia, having trained as a shinobi so that he might honor his adoptive father by helping others as he once helped him. Perhaps his chivalrous guise also hid a personal vendetta, he admits, but more than anything he yearned to reclaim that sword—the last memento of their life together—and wear it at his side with pride.</p>
<p>Shigure realizes that Master Akebono was the thief’s primary target all along. The break-in at the shop in the Rakuza District had been a search for the Soboro Sukehiro, and the string of daring thefts against other disreputable merchants was intended to force Akebono to take extra precautions that would reveal where the sword was hidden. Hildibrand claps his hands and declares that the Soboro Sukehiro must be returned to its rightful owner. Nashu then wonders aloud how Yojimbo planned to reach the Isle of Zekki in the first place if it is so difficult for others to get there. Shigure answers that he does not know, but if Yojimbo truly went that way, someone must have seen him. The best course is to question the pirates at Sakazuki and ask if anyone has glimpsed a traveler matching his description. Hildibrand, delighted to be of the same mind, urges everyone to set out at once.</p>
<p>Back at Sakazuki, Hildibrand sweeps out an arm and invites you to begin your inquiries. You first turn to Ihaki, who recognizes you immediately and asks if you are still searching for dead men. When you describe a rail-thin samurai with a wide-brimmed hat and oversized geta, he grows thoughtful before shaking his head. A traveler like that would not slip past his attention, he assures you, which means he has not seen him at all. He apologizes for disappointing you, but Hildibrand cheerfully thanks him for his time and reminds you that if at first you do not succeed, you simply ask again elsewhere. As you move on, Ihaki watches the departing inspector and admits to himself that something about that “gentleman” feels disturbingly familiar, not unlike the dead man he once saw drifting in a boat. Nashu, meanwhile, muses that Shigure looks much better in his new outfit than he ever did in his Sekiseigumi uniform, and Shigure quietly admits that he never imagined the Wolf Burglar would have such a tragic past. Perhaps he judged him too harshly. The Wolf Burglar brushes aside his own story and tells you to forget it; what matters now is finding Yojimbo and the sword. Hildibrand agrees and leads you to the next potential witness, a Confederate shipwatch. When you describe the same lanky samurai with a large hat, the sailor immediately recalls speaking with such a traveler—one who also had a dog at his side. The man fully intended to go to the Isle of Zekki despite warnings about the Red Kojin’s hostility and the island’s lack of any proper dock. The shipwatch tried to dissuade him, but the traveler simply shrugged and went on his way. Later, the sailor believes he saw that same dog wandering alone on the beach below and can only hope it was not abandoned. Hildibrand thanks him profusely, convinced that the canine in question can only be Daigoro. You must gather your companions and search for Jim’s faithful partner without delay.</p>
<p>On the nearby shore, Hildibrand calls out for Daigoro, his voice carrying over the surf. Nashu squints into the distance and thinks she spots the dog, only to wilt when he turns tail and trots away; perhaps he does not like you anymore. The Wolf Burglar reassures her that all Daigoro needs is the right incentive, though Shigure doubts it can truly be that simple. The proof comes quickly. At the sight and scent of a few koban offered in an outstretched hand, Daigoro barks, sniffs eagerly, and presses in close, tail wagging. Shigure mutters that it seems all it takes to win the dog over is a handful of coins, calling him a greedy little thing. Hildibrand hushes him and insists that Daigoro is a very good dog, then declares that with this “incentive” secured, the hound will lead you straight to his master. Daigoro dashes off, and you follow him to a stretch of coastline where you find Yojimbo brooding over his predicament. The dog’s bark draws his attention; he turns, surprised to see Daigoro here after telling him to wait elsewhere—and even more surprised to see Hildibrand. The inspector strides forward and calls him “Jim,” only to immediately correct himself and accuse him of shenanigans, demanding that he surrender the Soboro Sukehiro at once. Yojimbo flatly refuses. Ever since he was bested by your tight-lipped, laconic companion, he explains, he has been searching for stronger swords so that he can truly test his mettle. He believes that wielding the Ame-no-Murakumo is the key to his ultimate victory, and if circumstances demand the matter be settled here and now, so be it. He warns you that if you stand in his way, he will be merciless. Shigure hastily urges you to stay your hand, insisting that securing the sword is a solemn duty that properly falls to him and the Sekiseigumi, but Hildibrand loudly overrules him. As an agent of enquiry and inspector extraordinaire, he declares, he will resolve this conflict and reclaim the sword himself. Then, with theatrical flourish, he calls Daigoro over for a grand belly rub.</p>
<p>Yojimbo orders Daigoro not to obey, but the dog bolts straight into Hildibrand’s arms, rolling for scratches. The sight leaves Yojimbo stunned. Nashu quietly suggests that perhaps the inspector smells of money, given his wealthy upbringing. Hildibrand then announces his ultimatum: until Yojimbo relinquishes the Soboro Sukehiro, he will continue to give Daigoro the most furious, ecstatic belly rubs imaginable, depriving his master of that joy. Yojimbo desperately calls for Daigoro to return, but the dog remains happily at the inspector’s side. At length, the swordsman sags in defeat and concedes that Hildibrand has won; the sword is yours. Shigure can hardly believe such tactics actually worked and murmurs that the inspector’s powers of negotiation are astonishing. Before Hildibrand can properly savor the victory, however, confusion erupts. He cries out in dismay as he realizes the blade is no longer in his grasp. Yojimbo, too, looks around wildly and asks where the Soboro Sukehiro has gone. The answer comes from the Wolf Burglar, who now holds the weapon and coolly proclaims that it rests exactly where it belongs. Yojimbo snarls and demands its return, calling him a fiend, but has no chance to reclaim it. A stern voice orders all of you to halt, and a Solemn Sekiseigumi officer steps out with his men. The Wolf Burglar curses under his breath, surprised at how suddenly they appeared, while Yojimbo takes advantage of the chaos to flee, vowing that this is not over. The officer turns on Shigure and demands an explanation, having heard that he and Hildibrand freed a notorious fugitive. Stammering, Shigure admits that in order to track down Yojimbo and the Soboro Sukehiro, he and the inspector temporarily removed the Wolf Burglar from his cell, intending all along to return him once the investigation was complete. The officer coldly asks how Shigure plans to do that now that his prisoner has flown. He formally charges Shigure with aiding and abetting a criminal’s escape. Hildibrand steps between them and pleads for reason, insisting that everything Shigure did was in pursuit of a greater good and in service to the law of the land. He swears that you will return with both the reclaimed sword and the Wolf Burglar. The Sekiseigumi officer acknowledges Hildibrand’s past deeds but refuses to bend. Shigure must still answer for his own actions, he says, and making an exception would only compound the offense. No man is above the law—not even one of their own.</p>
<p>With Yojimbo gone, the Wolf Burglar vanished, and Shigure taken into custody, only you, Nashu, and Hildibrand remain. Nashu glances around the suddenly quiet shore and remarks that it feels strangely empty with everyone else gone, hoping aloud that they are all right. Hildibrand fumes that it is a terrible miscarriage of justice to see Shigure whisked away like a common criminal when the circumstances are so clearly extenuating. Nonetheless, this is not the place to devise a rescue. He urges you both to return to Kugane and think of a way to set things right. Back in the Rakuza District, Nashu admits that it feels lonely without the rest of your motley allies and worries for their safety. Hildibrand, for his part, confesses that since coming back he has been racking his brain for a way to free Shigure, but nothing has yet come to mind. The Wolf Burglar’s escape with the sword has complicated matters, but he does not believe the tale of the samurai and Master Akebono was a lie. His keen inspector’s sense tells him that all the threads of this story are drawing toward a single point in the near future, when every hidden truth will be revealed. Nashu brightens at that, saying it is exactly the sort of thing she wanted to hear. She agrees that the Wolf Burglar does not seem truly bad at heart and is certain that once the Sekiseigumi understand, they will surely show Shigure mercy. Hildibrand wholeheartedly concurs and resolves to hasten that outcome by investigating Master Akebono at once. He asks Nashu to hold the fort in his absence, and she snaps to attention, trusting that whatever he is planning will be brilliant. Elsewhere, Akebono himself muses that this day was inevitable. He is unfazed by the inspector’s interest; in his mind, it will not be long before nothing in this world lies beyond his grasp. A low, sinister chuckle escapes him as he looks toward the future.</p>

<p>紅玉海に浮かぶ小島ルビープライスで、あなたはナシュ・マカラッカ、ヒルディブランド、そしてウルフ・バーグラーとともに、シグレの到着を待っていた。ナシュは「衣装替えしたシグレが楽しみだ」と胸を弾ませ、ウルフ・バーグラーはふと、名刀を売りに出したらいくらになるのかとつぶやき、あなたの視線に気づくと「ただの正直な疑問だ」と肩をすくめる。やがて現れたシグレは、いつもの赤誠組の装束ではなく、クガネのコガネドリで買い求めたという普段とはまるで違う衣装に身を包んでいた。ヒルディブランドはその変貌を素直に称え、ナシュも「こんなにお洒落さんだったなんて」と目を輝かせ、シグレは「ファッション」などと言われて顔を赤くする。ウルフ・バーグラーは、その格好と草履の組み合わせをからかいながらも、ここに集った本来の目的──アメノムラクモを狙う収集家の行方──を思い出させる。狙いがゼッキ島であるなら、空から向かうか、水中を通るしかないが、コウジンの加護もなく、鳥も頼りにならない今、その道のりは決して易しくはない。そんな中、ヒルディブランドは、そもそもウルフ・バーグラーがなぜアケボノの店からソボロ助広を奪おうとしたのか、その真意をまだ聞いていないことを指摘する。</p>
<p>短い沈黙ののち、ウルフ・バーグラーは、自分は盗もうとしているのではなく、本来の持ち主から奪われたものを取り返そうとしているのだと語り始める。彼が語るのは、質素な暮らしを送りながらも、困っている者を決して見捨てなかった一人の侍の話である。ドマ占領のさなか、行き場を失ってクガネに流れ着いた人狼族の少年を、その侍は我が子のように受け入れ、ささやかだが温かな日々を共に送った。そこへある日、一人の商人が現れ、侍の刀に目をつけて執拗に売却を迫る。侍にとって刀は魂であり、いかなる大金を積まれようとも手放せない。商人はそこで引き下がることなく、貸し付けや取引を装って侍の生活に入り込み、少しずつ借金を膨らませていく。気づいた時には、返しきれないほどの負債が山のように積み上がっていた。最後の手段として、侍は刀を担保として差し出し、昼夜を問わぬ働きぶりで返済に励むが、やがて病に倒れ、そのまま帰らぬ人となる。残された少年は、唯一の形見であったソボロ助広までもがアケボノの手に渡ったことを知り、深い喪失と怒りを胸に刻む。</p>
<p>少年はやがてクガネを離れ、ヤンサで忍びの技を身につけて再び戻ってくる。表向きには強欲な商人から財を奪い、弱き者を助ける義賊のような振る舞いを見せながら、その根底には養父と仰いだ侍の魂の象徴である刀を取り戻したいという切なる願いがあった。ウルフ・バーグラーはアケボノの動向を執拗に見張り、ソボロ助広がどこへ隠されたのかを探り続けてきたのだと明かす。シグレは、彼が最初からアケボノこそを真の標的としていたこと、ラクザ地区の店に忍び込んだことも、悪徳商人ばかりを狙った一連の盗みも、すべては刀の隠し場所を暴くための布石だったことに気づく。ヒルディブランドは深く頷き、ソボロ助広は正当な持ち主のもとへ戻されねばならないと宣言する。ナシュが、到達が難しいゼッキ島へヨウジンボウがどうやって向かったのかと首を傾げると、シグレは「本当にあの島へ向かったのなら、その姿を見た者がいるはずだ」と告げ、サカヅキの海賊たちに聞き込みを行うことを提案する。</p>
<p>一行がサカヅキに渡ると、ヒルディブランドは「さあ、聞き込みですぞ」とあなたに先陣を任せる。まず声をかけたイハキは、あなたを見て冗談めかして「また死人でも探しているのか」と笑うが、広いつばの笠をかぶった痩せた侍について尋ねると、真剣な顔になり、「そんな旅人を見逃すはずがない」と言って首を横に振る。ヒルディブランドは、それでも話を聞かせてくれたことに礼を述べ、「最初の手が外れても、次の手を探せばよい」と前向きに次の聞き込みへ向かう。やがて、船の出入りを見張る海賊は、同じ特徴を持つ侍と犬を連れた旅人のことを思い出す。その侍はゼッキ島へ向かうつもりだと言い、紅玉海を支配する集団に歓迎されず、船を泊める場所もない危険な島だと忠告されても、構わず先へ進んだという。見張りは後になって、同じ犬と思しき姿を浜辺で一匹で見かけたことも語り、置き去りにされたのではないかと心配する。ヒルディブランドはその証言に感謝し、その犬がダイゴロウに違いないと確信して仲間たちを促し、紅玉海の浜辺へ向かう。</p>
<p>波打ち際でヒルディブランドがダイゴロウの名を呼ぶと、遠くの岩陰に小さな影が見える。ナシュは「あそこにいるかも」と目を凝らすが、犬は警戒しているのか、なかなか近づいてこない。そこでウルフ・バーグラーが一歩前に出て、「必要なのは正しいご褒美だ」と言って小判を取り出す。シグレが半信半疑のまま見守る中、ダイゴロウは鼻をひくつかせ、小判の匂いに引き寄せられるように尻尾を振って駆け寄り、吠えながら懐いていく。その様子にシグレは「ずいぶん欲張りな犬だ」と苦笑するが、ヒルディブランドは「実に良い子だ」と目を細め、主人のもとへ案内してくれるよう頼みかける。ダイゴロウの足取りを追って進むと、崖の縁で思案にふけるヨウジンボウの姿を見つける。ダイゴロウの鳴き声に気づいたヨウジンボウは、ここにいるはずのない相棒と、あなたたちの姿を見て驚きの声を上げる。ヒルディブランドは進み出て、ふざけた真似はやめ、ソボロ助広を返すよう強く迫る。</p>
<p>しかしヨウジンボウは刀を離さない。かつて寡黙な戦士に敗北して以来、彼は再起の機会を求め、より強き刀を探し求めてきたのだと語る。アメノムラクモこそが悲願を果たすための鍵であり、その行く手を阻む者には容赦しないと宣言する。シグレは、刀を確保する責任は本来赤誠組にあると制止しようとするが、ヒルディブランドはそれを遮り、自らが「紳士探偵」としてこの争いを収めると胸を張る。そしてダイゴロウを抱き寄せ、お腹を撫で回しながら、ヨウジンボウがソボロ助広を手放すまで、このご褒美を独り占めにすると言い放つ。ヨウジンボウが必死にダイゴロウを呼び戻しても、犬は気持ちよさそうに喉を鳴らし、ヒルディブランドのそばを離れようとしない。やがてヨウジンボウは肩を落として敗北を認め、刀を渡すことに同意する。シグレは、こんなやり取りが本当に功を奏したことに目を丸くし、ヒルディブランドの交渉術に舌を巻く。</p>
<p>だが、勝利の余韻に浸る間もなく事態は急変する。ヒルディブランドがふと手元を見やると、握っていたはずのソボロ助広の姿が消えている。周囲を見回したヨウジンボウも「刀はどこだ」と叫ぶが、答えはすぐに明らかになる。離れた場所に立つウルフ・バーグラーが刀を手にし、「本来あるべきところに戻っただけだ」と静かに告げるのだ。ヨウジンボウは激しく怒り、「今すぐ返せ」と叫ぶが、その瞬間、鋭い声が一行を制止する。「そこまでだ」と姿を現したのは、部下を率いた赤誠組の役人である。ウルフ・バーグラーは思わず舌打ちし、ヨウジンボウは混乱に乗じて逃げ去ってしまう。役人はシグレに向き直り、悪名高い罪人を勝手に牢から出したという噂が真実かどうかを問いただす。シグレは、ソボロ助広とヨウジンボウの行方を追うにはウルフ・バーグラーの協力が不可欠であり、捜査のために一時的に牢から出したに過ぎないと必死に弁明するが、役人は冷ややかに、逃げられてしまった今どうやって戻すつもりなのかと問い返す。そして、シグレを犯罪者の逃亡を幇助した罪で拘束すると告げる。ヒルディブランドは一歩前に出て、シグレの行動がすべてより大きな正義とこの国の法を守るためであったと訴え、必ずソボロ助広とウルフ・バーグラーを連れ戻すと誓うが、決定は覆らない。シグレは連行され、浜辺には、あなたとナシュ、ヒルディブランドの三人だけが取り残される。</p>
<p>仲間たちが連れ去られたあとの浜辺は、先ほどまでの賑わいが嘘のように静まり返る。ナシュは、「ヨウジンボウもウルフ・バーグラーも、シグレもいなくなると急に寂しいね」と肩を落としながら、それでも皆が無事であるようにと願いを口にする。ヒルディブランドは、事情を顧みずにシグレを罪人として扱った今回の一件を「正義の歪み」だと憤り、何としてもこの不当な状況を正さねばならないと決意を固める。ただし、ここは策を練るにはふさわしくないと判断し、一度クガネに戻って出直すことを提案する。ラクザ地区に戻ると、ナシュは仲間たちがいない街がどこか物足りなく感じられると打ち明け、皆の行く末を案じる。ヒルディブランドは、戻ってきてからずっとシグレを救う方法を考え続けてきたが、まだ完全な妙案には至っていないと正直に語る。それでも、ウルフ・バーグラーが語った侍とアケボノの話が作り話だとは思えず、ソボロ助広やアメノムラクモ、ヨウジンボウ、ウルフ・バーグラー、アケボノ──それぞれに散らばった糸が、近い将来ひとつの場所へと収束し、その場で真実が明らかになると、探偵としての勘が告げているのだと続ける。ナシュはその言葉に顔を明るくし、ウルフ・バーグラーの本当の想いさえ伝われば、赤誠組もきっとシグレを許してくれるはずだと信じて疑わない。</p>
<p>ヒルディブランドは、ただその時を待つのではなく、自ら真相の中心へと踏み込むべきだと考える。彼は、この一連の出来事の中心人物としてアケボノの名を挙げ、今すぐ調査に乗り出すと宣言する。そしてナシュに留守を任せると、勢いよく踵を返し、商人の素顔を暴くべく街の中へと消えていく。その頃、クガネの片隅では、アケボノがひとり薄笑いを浮かべていた。遅かれ早かれ、この日が訪れることは承知のうえだと言わんばかりに肩をすくめ、なおも手の届く先にある富と力を思い描く。ソボロ助広に続き、さらに多くの価値ある品々を手中に収め、いずれはこの世のあらゆるものを思いのままに操れると信じているかのように、くぐもった笑い声を残して闇の中へと姿を消していく。</p>

<p>在 Ruby Price 的碼頭上，海風帶著鹹味從 The Ruby Sea 吹來。你和 Nashu、Hildibrand 以及 Wolf Burglar 一起等著 Shigure 抵達。Nashu 幾乎快要站不住，一邊來回踱步一邊說自己迫不及待想看 Shigure 的「新造型」。Wolf Burglar 則若有所思地看向你，突然開口問，如果真的把那把名刀拿去賣，價值會有多少。見你臉色一沉，他連忙聳肩說那只是單純的好奇心而已。先前他提議搭乘渡船，在這裡跟 Shigure 會合，你們便照做來到 Ruby Price。終於，一個熟悉的身影出現在碼頭上，Hildibrand 立刻張開雙手用力揮舞，大聲喊著要他到這邊來。Wolf Burglar 一開始還嚇了一跳，以為是別人，直到看清那其實是換了一身裝扮的 Shigure。Shigure 有些不好意思地解釋，他被建議暫時不要再穿 Sekiseigumi 的制服，於是便去了一趟 Kogane Dori，刻意買了一套和自己平常風格完全不同的服裝。Hildibrand 馬上給出高度評價，說這個改變非常成功；Nashu 更是驚呼原來 Shigure 也可以這麼時髦。面對「fashionable」這種形容，Shigure 臉都紅了，只能連連否認。Wolf Burglar 則刻薄地吐槽說那身打扮配上那雙草履，很難想像會變成新的流行。不過他隨即一轉話題，提醒大家你們不是為了閒聊才聚在這裡。若 collector 的目標真的是 Ame-no-Murakumo，那下一站就必須前往 Isle of Zekki。無論是從空中還是走海底通道，要抵達那裡都遠比預想中麻煩。Shigure 認為沒有 Kojin 的 blessing，從水底接近幾乎是不可能的方案；Wolf Burglar 則提到 Montaro 時乾笑一聲，表示在經過先前 Inspector 那一番折騰之後，那隻鳥恐怕會離你們遠遠的，就算飛得動也不會再來幫忙。就在這樣的討論之中，Hildibrand 突然轉向這位 Lupin 盜賊，用相當直接的口氣指出，大家其實一直沒有聽他說清楚，為什麼要去 Master Akebono 那裡偷 Soboro Sukehiro，尤其在 Koju 都說那種刀根本很難轉手賣出之後。</p>
<p>Wolf Burglar 默默沉默了一會兒，最後才說，從黑心商人手中取回原本就屬於別人的東西，不算是偷。他接著講起一段故事，故事的主角是一位過得十分樸素的 samurai。那位 samurai 遠離奢華、生活簡單，卻從不對有需要的人視而不見。有一天，他收留了一名在 Doma 佔領期間逃出來的 Lupin 少年，把對方當成親生兒子一樣照顧。兩人生活中說得上珍貴的東西不多，彼此的陪伴算是其中唯一的「奢侈品」。某天，一名 merchant 上門打聽這位 samurai 的刀，希望能用高額金錢把這唯一的寶物買走。但對一名 samurai 來說，刀就是靈魂，他寧可付出性命，也不願把刀賣掉。那名 merchant 並不是會乖乖放棄的人，他改變策略，慢慢介入 samurai 的生活，用各種理由借錢給他，一開始只是小額，之後越滾越大。等 samurai 回過神來，債務已經堆成一座山，最後只好把刀當成債務的抵押品。為了找回自己的榮譽，samurai 幾乎日夜不眠地工作，卻因為身體羸弱而病倒，不久後便離世，留下那名 Lupin 少年獨自面對這不公的一切。Wolf Burglar 說，那個少年之後離開了 Kugane，過了好幾年，才從 Yanxia 回來。那時他已經學會 shinobi 的技藝，希望能像當年救過自己的義父一樣，換成自己去幫助別人。即便這份「俠義」背後，或多或少帶著個人的 vendetta，他真正渴望的，始終是拿回那名 samurai 留下的最後紀念──那把 Soboro Sukehiro，好讓自己能驕傲地佩在腰間。聽到這裡，Shigure 終於明白這一路上種種事件背後的脈絡。原來從一開始，Master Akebono 就是 Wolf Burglar 鎖定的主要目標，而他闖進 Rakuza District 那間店，其實就是要尋找 Soboro Sukehiro。那些專挑惡德 merchant 下手的連環盜竊，看似各自為戰，實際上都是為了逼迫 Akebono 想盡辦法保護那把刀，好藉機找出它真正被藏在哪裡。Hildibrand 聽完後拍了拍手，說既然如此，那把刀就非得物歸原主不可。Nashu 這時突然想到一件事，問既然如此難以抵達 Isle of Zekki，那 Yojimbo 一開始是打算怎麼到那裡的。Shigure 坦言自己也不知道，但如果他真的朝那個方向去了，總會有人在途中見到他。現在最明智的做法，就是回到 Sakazuki 去問問 pirate，有沒有看過和 Yojimbo 相似的 traveler。Hildibrand 很高興兩人的想法不謀而合，立刻揮手要大家一起動身。</p>
<p>回到 Sakazuki 後，Hildibrand 打開雙手，笑著要你打頭陣開始問路。你首先找到的是之前就幫過你們的 Ihaki。他認出你來，打趣問你是不是又在找死掉的人。聽你描述那名身材瘦長、戴著寬邊帽、踩著巨大木屐的 samurai，他認真地想了一會兒，最後搖頭說，如果真有那樣的 traveler，自己不可能沒注意到，所以應該沒見過。說完他還為幫不上忙而道歉，但 Hildibrand 完全沒有失望的意思，反而很有精神地道謝，並且說如果第一次問不到答案，那就去下一個地方再問一次。當你們離開時，Ihaki 望著遠去的紳士身影，心想那位「gentleman」有種令人毛骨悚然的熟悉感，彷彿讓他想起之前在船上看到的那個「死在船裡的人」。走在路上，Nashu 一邊看著 Shigure，一邊說她真的覺得現在這套服裝比 Sekiseigumi 的制服更適合他。Shigure 則還沉浸在剛才聽到的故事裡，喃喃說自己完全沒想到 Wolf Burglar 會有那種過去，也許先前對他的判斷太過武斷。Wolf Burglar 卻表示那些過去就當作沒聽過吧，現在最重要的只有兩件事：找到 Yojimbo，還有奪回那把刀。Hildibrand 點頭，接著帶你去找下一位可能知道內情的證人──一名 Confederate 的船上守望者。當你把同樣的特徵說給他聽時，他立刻想起最近和自己說過話的旅人。那是一名瘦高的 samurai，身旁還帶著一隻 dog。那個人當時就說要前往 Isle of Zekki，儘管他極力勸告 Red Kojin 並不歡迎外人，而且島上也沒地方能安全停船，對方還是若無其事地走了。守望者回想起來，最近似乎在下面的沙灘上，看見那隻 dog 獨自徘徊，他只希望那人不是把狗丟在岸邊自己走了。Hildibrand 聽完連聲道謝，幾乎可以肯定那隻 dog 就是 Daigoro，於是說必須立刻把大家集合起來，一起去尋找 Jim 的愛犬。</p>
<p>於是，你們來到附近的海岸，Hildibrand 朝著浪聲喊出「Daigoro！」。Nashu 細細張望，很快在遠處發現疑似 Daigoro 的身影，然而對方看起來並不想靠近這裡，讓她有點沮喪地懷疑是不是狗已經不喜歡你們了。Wolf Burglar 卻安慰說，只要給他適合的誘因就行。Shigure 對此半信半疑，結果答案很快就揭曉。只見 Wolf Burglar 伸出手，掌心亮出幾枚 koban，Daigoro 立刻一邊吠叫一邊奔過來，拼命用鼻子在他身上嗅來嗅去，尾巴擺得飛快。Shigure 嘆氣說，看來要得到這隻狗的心，比起什麼忠誠或感情，一把小小的金幣反而更有用，真是個貪心的小傢伙。Hildibrand 聽了立刻叫他別亂說，堅持 Daigoro 是隻非常好的狗，並宣告既然如此，Daigoro 接下來一定會帶你們去找他的主人。Daigoro 果然一聲不吭就轉身跑了起來，你們也立刻跟上。最後，在一處海邊岩壁前，你們看到 Yojimbo 正對自己的處境發愁。Daigoro 的叫聲讓他轉頭，一看到狗出現在這種地方，立刻驚訝地問不是叫他好好待在原地嗎。接著，他又看見你們，以及那個他熟悉的「Hildy」，驚訝之情溢於言表。Hildibrand 大步上前，自稱為「Jim 的老朋友」又立刻改口，指責對方別再胡鬧，要立刻交出 Soboro Sukehiro。Yojimbo 斬釘截鐵地拒絕。他說，自從被你那位沉默寡言的同伴擊敗之後，就一直渴望再度一雪前恥，為此才開始尋找更強大的刀，希望能拿出自己全部的力量決一勝負。Ame-no-Murakumo 正是他認為能為自己帶來勝利的關鍵，既然形勢逼得你們必須在此決出輸贏，那他也奉陪到底。如果你們想擋在他面前，他絕不會留情。Shigure 趕緊對著你說，要你先冷靜下來。雖然他知道你出手的動機只是想做好事，但 Soboro Sukehiro 的保管責任依照規矩應該落在 Sekiseigumi 身上。不過 Hildibrand 完全沒打算讓話說完，他搶先一步宣布自己作為 agent of enquiry、inspector extraordinaire 的身分，會親自調解這整場紛爭，並把刀完完整整拿回來。說完，他故意擺出浮誇的姿勢，對 Daigoro 張開雙臂，邀請狗過來享受一場盛大的「肚肚搔癢」。</p>
<p>Yojimbo 當然立刻命令 Daigoro 不許過去，然而狗只是愣了一下，便毫不犹豫地衝進 Hildibrand 懷裡，在地上翻滾，把肚子整個朝天給他摸。這一幕讓 Yojimbo 簡直無言以對。Nashu 小聲猜測，Inspector 畢竟出身富裕家庭，也許身上真的有股「錢的味道」，難怪狗會這麼靠過去。Hildibrand 則趁勢提出自己的條件：只要 Yojimbo 還不願意交出 Soboro Sukehiro，他就會繼續用全力給 Daigoro 做最「瘋狂」的肚肚按摩，讓主人無緣享受到這份幸福。這就是他的 ultimatum。Yojimbo 焦急地不停呼喚 Daigoro 回到自己身邊，然而這隻狗依舊黏在 Hildibrand 身旁，樂得不想離開。最後，Yojimbo 終於垮下肩膀，承認自己輸了，同意把刀交給你們。Shigure 看到這種談判方式居然真的奏效，只能感嘆 Inspector 的「交涉能力」實在驚人。然而勝利的氣氛並沒有維持太久。Hildibrand 突然發出一聲慘叫，這才發現自己手中已經空空如也。Yojimbo 也環顧四周，驚訝地問 Soboro Sukehiro 到底跑哪去了。答案來自另一側的身影──Wolf Burglar 此刻正握著那把刀，平靜地說這把劍現在回到本該屬於它的地方。Yojimbo 怒吼著要他立刻還劍，稱他為 fiend，卻還來不及衝上前。這時，一道嚴厲的聲音高喊「全員不許動！」，Solemn Sekiseigumi 帶著手下出現在你們周圍。Wolf Burglar 忍不住爆了句粗口，完全沒想到他們會在這時候冒出來。Yojimbo 則趁亂抽身離開，留下「這件事還沒完」的話便消失在視線中。Sekiseigumi 的組士很快把矛頭對準 Shigure，質問他是不是親手放走一名惡名昭彰的犯人，要他立刻說清楚。Shigure 結結巴巴地說，為了追查 Yojimbo 和 Soboro Sukehiro 的行蹤，他與 Inspector 決定暫時把 Wolf Burglar 從牢裡帶出來，打算等任務結束後再把他送回去。組士冷著臉反問，既然犯人此刻已經逃走，那他究竟打算怎麼做到「送回牢房」這件事。接著，他當場宣告要以「協助犯罪者逃獄」的罪名起訴 Shigure。Hildibrand 立刻站出來替他說話，請組士冷靜一點，強調 Shigure 所有的行動都是為了更大的正義，也是為了維護這片土地的法律。他發誓你們一定會帶著 Soboro Sukehiro 和 Wolf Burglar 一起回來。然而，那名組士雖然承認自己知道 Hildibrand 過去的貢獻，但仍然表示 Shigure 必須為自己的行為負責。如果因為 Inspector 的請求就特別放他一馬，反而只會讓事情變得更糟。對 Sekiseigumi 來說，沒有人能凌駕於法律之上，即便是自己人也不例外。</p>
<p>結果就是，Yojimbo 逃了、Wolf Burglar 也不見蹤影，連 Shigure 都被帶走，只剩你、Nashu 和 Hildibrand 三人站在變得異常安靜的海邊。Nashu 四下打量了一圈，覺得沒有大家在身邊，世界一下子安靜得有些不習慣，忍不住喃喃說希望他們都平安無事。Hildibrand 則怒斥這一切是對正義的極大扭曲，把 Shigure 像普通罪犯一樣押走，完全無視事情的前因後果，怎麼想都說不過去。不過，他也知道在這裡想辦法並不合適，於是提議先回到 Kugane，再好好思考如何彌補這場錯誤。於是，你們回到 Hingashi 的 Rakuza District。Nashu 看著街道上來往的人潮，說少了大家陪在身邊，總覺得空氣冷清了不少，也忍不住擔心起其他人的近況。Hildibrand 這時對你坦承，自從回來之後，他一直絞盡腦汁想著該怎麼救出 Shigure，卻始終沒有想到萬全之策。Wolf Burglar 把刀帶走，讓局面變得更棘手，但他並不認為對方講的 samurai 和 Akebono 的故事是捏造的。根據他自豪的「名偵探直覺」，這段故事裡所有散落的線索，很快就會在某個不遠的時間點全部匯聚在同一個地方，屆時所有真相都會被攤在陽光下讓人看得一清二楚。Nashu 聽了眼睛一亮，說這就是她想聽到的話。她也同意 Wolf Burglar 並不是真正意義上的壞人，等 Sekiseigumi 弄清楚整件事情的來龍去脈，一定會願意放 Shigure 一馬。Hildibrand 完全贊同這個想法，並表示要加速迎來那天，就必須立刻開始調查 Master Akebono。他請 Nashu 在這裡守好「陣地」，自己則要先一步去追查那名可疑 merchant 的底細。Nashu 立正敬禮，雖然不知道 Inspector 下一步打算做什麼，卻始終相信他一定會想出很厲害的計畫。另一頭，Akebono 獨自站在店裡陰影之中，冷冷地自言自語，說這一天終究還是來了。不過，他絲毫不把這些當成威脅，反而認為再過不久，這個世界裡將不會有任何東西是自己伸手拿不到的。隨著這句話，他低聲笑了起來，那笑聲聽起來既得意又令人不安。</p>
