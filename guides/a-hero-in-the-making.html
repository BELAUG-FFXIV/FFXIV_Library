      <p>At the Waking Sands, Minfilia welcomes you back as both adventurer and ally, her gaze warm yet intent as she speaks of how far you have come. Not so long ago, you were merely one of countless souls seeking your way in Eorzea, but your courage and character saw you raised to the post of envoy, traveling the realm to aid those in need without asking anything in return. Your deeds convinced Y’shtola that the Scions would benefit from your strength, and scarcely had you joined their ranks before you stood before the primal Ifrit and prevailed. In a short span, you have accomplished much and won fame besides—and Minfilia warns that fame has its price. You are about to discover it when guests arrive: three officers, each bearing the colors of a Grand Company, though they insist that they have come not for the Scions, but for you. With practiced politeness and no small amount of flattery, the representatives of the Twin Adder, the Immortal Flames, and the Maelstrom all extol your virtues, each claiming you as one of their own and inviting you to join their banners. Minfilia explains that the Grand Companies would not normally go to such lengths for a single recruit; that they do so now is proof of how highly they regard you. She outlines their purpose—the all-encompassing organizations that marshal the martial, economic, and technological might of their city–states in times of danger—and reminds you that to serve a Grand Company is to serve its nation, sharing its burdens and its rewards. The choice of allegiance is not permanent, she assures you, but it is no small decision. To help you decide, she suggests you attend the remembrance services soon to be held in each city–state, where the leaders of the Grand Companies themselves will speak. Before sending you on your way, she presses a linkpearl into your hand so that the Scions may remain in contact wherever you roam, and gently urges you to consider joining a Grand Company—not just for your own protection, but so that your formidable power might be shared among comrades rather than borne alone.</p>
      <p>Seeking more practical details, you speak to Tataru, who shyly admits that the wave of attention crashing over you may be partly her fault—she might have sung your praises a touch too often, and to a few too many people. After a flustered promise to curb her enthusiasm (if need be by holding her own tongue), she outlines the remembrance services. If all goes to plan, the Order of the Twin Adder will host the first ceremony in Gridania, where Elder Seedseer Kan–E–Senna will address the people at Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre. Thereafter, you are to travel to Ul’dah to hear Flame General Raubahn Aldynn speak at the Royal Promenade, with rumors whispering of a special guest, and finally to Limsa Lominsa, where Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn will deliver her address in the Stateroom, accessible via the Admiral’s Lift by way of the sentry Zanthael. While she concedes that the order might change due to the difficulties of organizing such events, she advises you to follow this route all the same. Taking her words to heart, you journey first to Gridania, where you join a murmuring crowd beneath the open sky of Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre. As voices around you speak of loss and of the Seedseers gathered together, Kan–E–Senna steps forward beneath the entwined serpent standard and recounts Gridania’s history: how strangers once trembled before the greenwrath, earning the right to dwell beneath the boughs through humility and effort; how Hyur and Elezen sowed the seeds of their civilization, soon joined by folk of all races; how unity and the Matron’s blessing allowed Gridania to flourish. She speaks of peace embraced in accordance with the elementals’ will, of wars fought only in defense of the Twelveswood, of rallying under the Twin Adder banner against Garlean conquest, and of the sacrifices made on the blood-soaked fields of Carteneau and in the Calamity that followed. She does not shy from the present: internal strife, poachers and bandits, Ixal raids and the looming threat of beast tribes, all tearing at the fragile fabric of unity. Yet her call is not one of despair, but resolve—she bids the people remember the fallen not only in words, but through action, joining hands once more beneath the Twin Adder standard to heal the forest so that their children might live in harmony beneath the ancient trees.</p>
      <p>When the crowd disperses, you find yourself approached by a pair of youths who introduce themselves as Alphinaud and his sister Alisaie, “students of history” who are traveling the realm to witness these remembrances. Later, in a quieter moment, Alphinaud shares his observations with you. Gridania, he explains, must contend with two beast tribes: the warlike Ixal, ever eager to summon the bloodthirsty primal Garuda, and the capricious sylphs, who were once on friendly terms with Gridania but have grown distant since summoning Ramuh. The Gridanians dislike war and resort to open conflict only when pressed, clashing with the Ixal in self-defense while clinging to a fragile peace treaty with the sylphs. The Calamity left the Twelveswood grievously wounded, weakening both the forest and the elemental spirits that protect it, and the people hope that restoring the wood will restore their safety—a work that may take centuries. Meanwhile, Ixali incursions continue, emboldened by Garuda’s insatiable hunger for destruction, and sooner or later, Alphinaud predicts, Gridania will be drawn into all-out war whether it wishes to be or not. When that day comes, the Order of the Twin Adder will need all the help it can gather, and he cannot help but wonder how valuable the aid of a seasoned adventurer like you might prove, should the Elder Seedseer’s words have sown a seed in your heart.</p>
      <p>Your journey then takes you to Ul’dah, where the Royal Promenade is thronged with onlookers craning their necks to see Sultana Nanamo Ul Namo and Flame General Raubahn Aldynn. As Raubahn strides to the fore, the crowd erupts in cheers, and he raises his voice above the din, addressing the “souls of flame” drawn to the desert’s burning heart. He speaks proudly of Ul’dah’s long history under the line of Ul, of sand turned to gold by the wisdom of its rulers, and of prosperity granted by Nald’thal. Behind him, the banner of the Immortal Flames bears the scales of order balancing the jewel of prosperity and the flame of might, a symbol Alphinaud quietly draws to your attention. Raubahn invokes Ul’dah’s sacrifices at Carteneau, where the city–state spent more blood and coin than any other to lay low the VIIth Imperial Legion, and honors the absent dead as Thal’s honored guests. Yet he does not paint a flattering picture of the present: in the five years since the Calamity, the spirit of sacrifice has withered, leaving a people divided between rich and poor, Royalist and Monetarist, trader and soldier. The Amalj’aa choke Ul’dah’s trade routes, the Garleans pillage her resources, and refugees strain her capacity to provide. He demands to know whether this fractured, self-serving existence is truly the future the fallen bought with their lives and decries those who call such stagnation “living,” claiming that it dishonors the name of the Immortal Flames. His answer is a call to unity and renewed purpose: he urges the people to line not their own coffers, but those of the Immortal Flames, to seek wealth not by preying upon neighbors, but by restoring Ul’dah and the realm. When Nanamo herself steps forward, she declares that those who count Ul’dah’s wealth in gold are gravely mistaken—that the sultanate’s true riches lie in the health, happiness, and hopes of her people—and bids them raise aloft Ul’dah’s torch so that its flames might become a beacon to all Eorzea. The crowd thunders its approval, voices swelling for victory, fortune, and the sultana.</p>
      <p>Once more, Alphinaud stands beside you to interpret what you have seen. Ul’dah, he says, has a long, bloody history with the Amalj’aa, who worship the primal Ifrit whom you yourself have faced. The Ul’dahns do not shy away from confrontation; anything threatening their prosperity is crushed without hesitation. Thus far, they have relied on force of arms to smother Ifrit’s flames each time he is summoned, but their troubles do not end there. Garlemald remains a looming threat, its legions quiet yet ever present, while refugees flood into the city in numbers that no treasury can forever sustain. Resources are finite, even for Ul’dah. Meanwhile, the Amalj’aa summon Ifrit with growing frequency, and each time the Immortal Flames muster to defeat him, they pay the price in blood. The pattern is clear: a war of attrition that Ul’dah cannot endure indefinitely. It is no wonder, he observes, that the Immortal Flames are so eager to recruit new members. An adventurer of your experience would be a welcome reinforcement in such desperate times. For the sake of Ul’dah and the realm, he can only hope that the general’s words found an echo within you.</p>
      <p>Your final destination is Limsa Lominsa, where Zanthael at the Admiral’s Lift bids you hurry if you mean to attend the remembrance service, for the Admiral is about to speak. In the Stateroom, the air is thick with sea salt and expectation as Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn stands before a mass of citizens and sailors. She bids “brothers and sisters of the sea” look upon the crimson standard and feel pride swell within their hearts, a sentiment the crowd roars in answer. She recalls how, seven hundred summers past, their forebears ran aground in this bay and, guided by the Mother of Oceans, transformed a humble fishing village into the undisputed ruler of the five seas. Alphinaud quietly notes that the crimson field symbolizes the blood of fallen crewmates and the black longship the pirate vessels from which Lominsan power first sprang. Merlwyb recounts how, when the Garlean Empire advanced on Eorzea, Limsa Lominsa rallied under the reborn Maelstrom banner—Knights of the Barracuda and ruthless pirates alike answering the call—and fought with unmatched ferocity at Carteneau, where many never returned. She calls upon the people to remember those who fell for freedom’s sake and laments that five years of rebuilding have not yet healed the wounds of the Calamity. New threats rise unceasingly: the Sahagin come ashore seeking blood for Leviathan, kobolds pour from O’Ghomoro in Titan’s name, and Garlean flags already fly within Lominsan waters. Worse still, internal feuds between pirate factions sap their strength, turning blades inward while enemies gather without. In the face of such peril, the Admiral declares there is only one course—to mend the rift between pirates and the Maelstrom, to stand united with adventurers against both beast tribes and Empire, and to gather once more beneath the undying crimson standard. A crew without unity is no crew at all, she warns, only a collection of drowned men. With the Navigator’s guidance and the people’s pledged strength, she vows that Limsa’s great vessel will ride the waves until sea swallows all. The hall erupts with shouts of loyalty and oaths to follow her “to the seven hells,” cutlasses at the ready.</p>
      <p>After the speech, Alphinaud resumes his quiet commentary. Limsa Lominsa, he explains, is beset by two beast tribes of its own: the fishlike Sahagin, who worship the primal Leviathan, and the kobolds, who dwell beneath the earth and revere Titan. As if that were not enough, the Garleans have raised a fortress in Lominsan territory, and the city–state’s pirate heritage breeds endless internal strife and blood feuds. While factions squabble, their enemies sharpen their blades. If Limsa is to withstand the Empire, its people must first settle their own disputes and deal decisively with the primal threat. He expects that the Maelstrom will soon take bold action against the beast tribes, and predicts that their standard will be drenched in a deeper shade of crimson before long. In such times, the aid of a capable adventurer like you would be beyond question. Whether you will sail under the Admiral’s command, however, is a choice only you can make. As the last service concludes, Minfilia reaches out to you through your linkpearl, timing as uncannily perfect as ever. She confirms that the ceremonies have ended and reminds you that the Grand Company officers are waiting at the Waking Sands for your decision. Delighted though the Scions are to host them, she does not wish to keep them in suspense and urges you to hurry home.</p>
      <p>You return to the Solar, where Minfilia greets you and asks whether the leaders’ words were as illuminating as you had hoped. Each nation, she observes, is beset by its own troubles—beast tribes, primals, Garlean encroachment, internal division—and it is little wonder that your strength is in such demand. She wishes there were more like you, yet she also understands that you must feel the weight of the choice before you. She encourages you to rest and reflect for a time before giving your answer to the waiting officers. As she has said before, the Scions seek to preserve the future of all Eorzea, while the Grand Companies focus on protecting their own homelands. Similar purposes, but not identical paths. She repeats her conviction that, with power like yours, it is safer and wiser to stand within a company than alone: surrounded by comrades, you will share both the glory and the danger. At the same time, she assures you that joining a Grand Company does not mean severing your ties with the Scions; they will continue to rely on you, for the battles ahead will demand every ally they can muster. Eorzea is changing, she reminds you, and you have the power to shape that change. Though no one knows what tomorrow will bring, she believes that so long as you trust in yourself and your companions, there is nothing you cannot achieve.</p>
      <p>Far from the quiet of the Solar, in the bustling city of Ul’dah, another conversation unfolds. Alphinaud and Alisaie watch the crowds disperse, pondering the spectacle of banners and speeches you have just witnessed. Alphinaud wryly notes that only the gods know which “grand” company you will ultimately choose, but that the wheels of change are turning regardless. Alisaie, however, is less impressed. She derides the remembrance ceremonies as little more than standard-waving rallies that barely mentioned the Calamity or the true horrors of the Seventh Umbral Era. Alphinaud counters that such omissions are deliberate: the leaders have chosen not to speak of certain truths, such as the Warriors of Light who spared Eorzea from an even worse fate, because the realm’s wounds are still raw. Beast tribes and primals continue to exacerbate the pain, and he believes that dwelling on the past will not by itself heal Eorzea; instead, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, with support from the Grand Companies, must work to salve those wounds and move forward. Alisaie rejects the notion of entrusting the realm’s fate to rulers who rewrite history to suit themselves and vows to find another way to cure what ails the world. Alphinaud accepts that their paths may diverge, but insists that their destination is the same and that they will ultimately see eye to eye. As her attendants come to escort her away, he reflects that the burden of this fate is one they share; they will prevail together or not at all. Whatever remedy they seek, it must not only close the present wounds, but also keep old scars from tearing open anew.</p>

      <p>「砂の家」にて、ミンフィリアはあなたを迎え入れ、静かにこれまでの歩みを振り返る。つい先日まで、あなたはエオルゼアの片隅で道を模索する、数多の冒険者のひとりに過ぎなかった。しかし、その気骨と勇気が認められ、各地を巡る使者として任を託され、人々のために見返りを求めず奔走してきた。その活躍はヤ・シュトラの目にもとまり、「暁の血盟」があなたの力を得れば必ずや益となると確信させた。そして血盟に加わった矢先、あなたは蛮神イフリートと相まみえ、これを打ち倒してみせたのだ。短い期間に数多の偉業を成し遂げ、名声を得たあなたに、ミンフィリアは「名声には代償が伴う」と忠告する。その言葉どおり、ほどなくして客人が現れる。「暁」を訪ねてきたというより、むしろあなた個人を求めてきたと言うべき三人の使者──それぞれが、双蛇党、不滅隊、黒渦団を代表する士官たちである。彼らは丁重な礼を尽くしつつ、あなたの武勇を讃え、自らの隊こそがふさわしい居場所だと熱心に語る。ミンフィリアは、グランドカンパニーが新兵ひとりのためにここまで頭を下げるのは極めて異例であり、それだけ彼らがあなたを高く評価している証だと説明する。グランドカンパニーとは、国家のあらゆる軍事・経済・技術的資源を結集し、有事に備えるための総合組織であり、その隊に仕えることは、その国家に仕えることを意味する。国を守り、その理想を実現するために戦う代わりに、さまざまな褒賞や便宜が与えられるだろう。とはいえ、一度決めた所属が永遠に変えられないわけではないと、ミンフィリアはあなたを安心させる。それでも、軽々しく選べるものではないことに変わりはない。そこで彼女は、まもなく三都市で執り行われる「追悼式典」に出席し、各グランドカンパニーの長たちの演説を聞いてみてはどうかと提案する。旅立ちの前に、どこにいても血盟と連絡を取れるようにとリンクパールを託し、ひとりで力を振るうのではなく、仲間とともに戦果も危険も分かち合える場として、いずれかのグランドカンパニーに入隊することを強く勧めるのだった。</p>
      <p>実務的な段取りを確認すべく、あなたはタタルに声をかける。すると彼女は、あなたを巡る大騒ぎの一因は自分にあるかもしれないと、気まずそうに告白する。あなたの活躍を、つい嬉しくなってあちこちで語りすぎてしまったのだと認め、次からは文字どおり自分の舌を押さえてでも口を慎むと約束したのち、「追悼式典」について説明を始める。うまくいけば最初の式典はグリダニアで行われ、双蛇党の総司令であるカヌ・エ・センナが「ミィ・ケット野外音楽堂」で演説を行う予定だという。その後、ウルダハでは炎神将ラウバーン・アルディンが王宮前広場で民に語りかけ、特別な来賓も現れるとの噂がある。そして最後に、リムサ・ロミンサの提督メルウィブ・ブルーフィスウィンが、提督室にて演説を行うことになっている。そこへ向かうには、「提督の間」へ続くリフトの前にいるザンセルに身分を明かして入室許可を得る必要がある、とタタルは念を押す。日程の都合で順番が入れ替わる可能性もあるが、ひとまずこの順路に従うとよいとアドバイスを受け、あなたはまず黒衣森の都グリダニアへ向かう。ミィ・ケット野外音楽堂には、多くの市民が集い、失われた命と「三兄弟」の揃い踏みにざわめきを漏らしている。やがて、絡み合う双蛇の紋章を背にカヌ・エ・センナが進み出て、ここ五百年のグリダニアの歴史を語り始めた。精霊の怒りに怯え、大地の陰に身を潜めていた開拓民が、試練を乗り越えて森に受け入れられたこと。ヒューランとエレゼンが手を取り合って文明の種を蒔き、やがて多様な種族が加わったことで、マザーの加護と団結の水に育まれた国家が繁栄したこと。精霊の意思に従い平和を尊びながらも、森を脅かす者には剣を抜き、ガレマール帝国の侵略には双蛇党の旗のもとに結集して立ち向かったこと。そして、カルテノー平原と第七霊災がもたらした犠牲──傷ついた黒衣森の再生途上で、内外からの脅威に翻弄されている現状を隠さず語る。盗賊や密猟者、勢いを増すイクサル族と蛮神の影が、人々の結束を揺るがしているのだ。それでも彼女は絶望を語るのではない。今こそ倒れた者たちを言葉だけでなく行動によって讃え、再び双蛇党の旗のもとに手を取り合って、子らが森の下で調和のうちに暮らせる未来を取り戻そうと呼びかけるのだった。</p>
      <p>群衆が徐々に散っていく中、あなたのもとにひと組の若者が歩み寄る。アルフィノとアリゼーと名乗る双子は、自らを「歴史を学ぶ旅人」と称し、各地の追悼式典を巡っているのだと語る。その後、ふたりきりになった折に、アルフィノはグリダニアの置かれた状況をあらためて解き明かしてくれる。グリダニアは二つの蛮族と向き合わねばならない。一方は、好戦的なイクサル族であり、血に飢えた蛮神ガルーダをしばしば呼び降ろす危険な存在だ。もう一方は、元来は人懐こく悪意よりも悪戯を好むシルフ族であり、長らく友好関係を築いてきたが、蛮神ラムウを召喚した頃から態度が変わり、最近では距離を置くようになっているという。グリダニアの民は争いを好まず、武力衝突は最後の手段と考えている。イクサル族との戦いも専ら自衛のためであり、シルフ族とは辛うじて和平を保っているに過ぎない。しかし第七霊災によって黒衣森は深く傷つき、精霊の力も弱まり、森そのものが脆くなってしまった。人々は森を癒やし、かつての加護を取り戻そうと願っているものの、それは何百年もかかる気の遠くなるような作業だろう。だが、そのあいだにもガルーダに煽られたイクサル族の侵攻は続き、やがて望むと望まざるとに関わらず、全面戦争に巻き込まれる日が来るとアルフィノは予測する。そのとき、双蛇党は可能な限りの助力を必要とするはずであり、エルダー・シードシーアの言葉があなたの胸に何らかの決意を芽生えさせたなら、その力は計り知れない価値を持つだろうと、彼はさりげなく示唆するのだった。</p>
      <p>次にあなたが向かったのは、砂都ウルダハである。ナル大門を抜け、「王宮前広場」へと足を踏み入れると、ナナモ・ウル・ナモ女王陛下と炎神将ラウバーン・アルディンの姿を一目見ようと、多くの民が息を呑んで見上げている。ラウバーンが一歩前に出ると、広場は歓声に包まれ、彼は「炎の魂よ」と呼びかけながら、灼熱の砂漠に集う者たちに向けて声を張り上げる。古の時代から続くウル朝の英邁な統治のもと、砂が黄金へと変わってきた歴史。ナルザルの恩寵を受けて、民が繁栄を謳歌してきたこと。アルフィノが静かに指し示す不滅隊の旗には、秩序を象徴する金の天秤が、繁栄の宝玉と力の炎を釣り合わせる紋章として描かれている。その標のもと、カルテノー平原においてウルダハは血と黄金を誰よりも多く注ぎ込み、第VII軍団を打ち倒すために戦ったのだとラウバーンは誇らしげに語る。そして、戦場から還らなかった同胞たちが、今やナルザルの客人として彼岸で幸福にあるよう祈りを捧げる。しかし、彼は現在の状況を決して美化しない。第七霊災から五年、かつてあった「献身の精神」はすっかり影を潜め、貧富の差やモナタリストとロイヤリストの対立などにより、人々の心は分断されてしまった。アマルジャ族は交易路を脅かし、ガレマール帝国は国境を嘲笑うように資源を奪っていく。難民は後を絶たず、いかにウルダハの財貨が豊富であっても限界はある。ラウバーンは、このような有様が本当に、同胞たちが命を賭して守ろうとした「偉大なる国家」の姿と言えるのかと問いただす。こんな暮らしを「生きている」と呼ぶ者たちは、不滅隊の名を汚し、ただゆっくりと死へ向かっているにすぎないと厳しく断じる。彼の答えは、団結と再起への呼びかけだ。己の懐ではなく不滅隊の財源を満たし、隣人から奪うのではなく、ウルダハとエオルゼア全体の繁栄を取り戻すために力を注ぐべきだと説く。やがて女王ナナモ自らが前に出て、ウルダハの富を貨幣で量る者たちは重大な勘違いをしていると告げる。真の富とは、人々の健やかさ、幸福、そして希望にこそ宿るのだと。彼女は、民にウルダハの松明を高く掲げさせ、その炎をエオルゼア全土を照らす灯火とせよと呼びかける。広場は歓声に沸き、「ウルダハのために！」と声が響き渡る。</p>
      <p>再びアルフィノが横に立ち、ウルダハの現状について補足する。ウルダハには、蛮神イフリートを崇めるアマルジャ族との長い確執の歴史がある。あなたの表情を見る限り、彼らと既に顔を合わせたこともあるのだろうと、アルフィノは軽く微笑む。ウルダハの民は対立を恐れず、繁栄を脅かすものがあれば徹底的に叩き潰そうとする気質を持つ。その結果、これまではイフリートが召喚されるたびに軍勢を差し向け、その炎を力ずくで鎮めてきた。しかし問題はそれだけではない。ガレマール帝国は五年間静観しているように見えるが、決して去ったわけではないし、難民は今もなおウルダハを目指して押し寄せている。いかに王政の財貨が豊かであろうとも、底なしというわけにはいかず、物資も有限だ。そして、アマルジャ族がイフリートを呼び降ろす頻度は増す一方であり、そのたびに不滅隊は軍を送り出し、勝利と引き換えに血を流している。このままでは、消耗戦の末に立ち行かなくなるのは目に見えている。だからこそ、不滅隊が必死に新たな戦力を集めようとしているのも不思議ではない、とアルフィノは言う。今のような切迫した状況であれば、豊富な経験を持つあなたのような冒険者は、彼らにとって実に心強い存在となるだろう。炎神将の言葉が、あなたの心のどこかに響いていればよいのだが──彼はそんな期待を込めて、ウルダハの演説を締めくくる。</p>
      <p>最後にあなたが向かったのは、海都リムサ・ロミンサだ。「提督の間」へ続く昇降機の前で、ザンセルがあなたを呼び止める。追悼式典に出席するなら急ぎなさい、提督の演説がまもなく始まる、と。許可を得て提督室に足を踏み入れると、潮の香りと熱気に満ちた空間で、メルウィブ・ブルーフィスウィン提督が多くの市民と船乗りを前に立っている。彼女は、「海の兄弟姉妹たちよ」と呼びかけ、緋色の軍旗を仰ぎ見るよう促す。その声に応え、群衆は喝采を上げる。七百年もの昔、先人たちがこの入り江へ流れ着いて以来、海の母の導きのもと、リムサ・ロミンサは小さな漁村から五大洋を支配する海洋国家へと成長してきたのだと、メルウィブは誇らしげに語る。アルフィノは、提督が指し示した紅の旗は、倒れた仲間たちの血を象徴する緋色の地と、かつての海賊船を象る黒い船影から成っていると説明する。帝国軍がエオルゼアに進軍した際、リムサ・ロミンサは黒渦団の旗のもとに再び結集し、「バラクーダ騎士団」から凶悪な海賊団に至るまで、ありとあらゆる勢力がカルテノー平原の戦場へと集った。その日、世界はリムサ・ロミンサの結束した力を目の当たりにした。誰よりも激しく勇敢に戦ったが、多くの仲間が海へと還っていったのだと、彼女は黙祷を捧げながら語る。第七霊災から五年、復興に努めてきたものの、傷跡はいまだ癒えず、サハギン族はリヴァイアサンの名のもとに血を求めて上陸し、オ・ゴモロの坑道からはタイタンを信奉するコボルド族が南下を続けている。こうした蛮族の脅威だけでなく、ガレマール帝国はリムサ・ロミンサのすぐ近くに要塞を築き、旗を掲げているのだ。にもかかわらず、海賊国家としての出自ゆえに、港町には派閥同士の血なまぐさい抗争が絶えず、仲間同士で剣を向け合っているあいだにも、外敵は刃を研ぎ続けている。メルウィブは、このままでは、揺らぐ船に押し寄せる波とともに沈むだけだと警告する。そして、蛮族と帝国の双方に立ち向かうためには、黒渦団と海賊の間に生じた亀裂を埋め、冒険者たちと共に一枚岩となるしかないと宣言するのだった。「結束なき乗組員は、既に溺死したも同然だ」と厳しく言い放ち、不滅の緋色の軍旗の下に集い、その力と技と知恵を捧げよと呼びかける。航海神の導きさえあれば、この船は海がすべてを呑み込むその日まで波を乗り越えていけるはずだと、彼女は高らかに宣言し、場内は「提督万歳！」の声に包まれる。</p>
      <p>提督の演説が終わると、アルフィノは再びあなたの隣に立ち、リムサ・ロミンサの背景を語って聞かせる。ここもまた二つの蛮族に悩まされている。ひとつは魚のような姿をしたサハギン族であり、蛮神リヴァイアサンを崇める存在だ。もうひとつは地中深くに暮らすコボルド族であり、蛮神タイタンを神として奉じている。そして、蛮族の存在だけでも厄介だというのに、ガレマール帝国はリムサ・ロミンサの「裏庭」とも言うべき場所に要塞を築き、鋭い視線を送り続けている。さらに海賊国家という成り立ちから、町の内部では派閥争いや血の報復が絶えず、仲間同士で刃を交えている間に、敵は着々と攻勢の機会を窺っているのだ。帝国に立ち向かうためには、まず自分たちの内輪揉めを収拾し、蛮神の脅威を決着させなければならないだろうとアルフィノは言う。そのために、黒渦団は近いうちに蛮族に対して決定的な行動に出るはずであり、そのときには軍旗がさらに深い紅に染まるだろうと予想する。そんな時代において、あなたのような有能な冒険者の助力が貴重であることは疑いようもない。だが、提督の船に乗り込むかどうかを決めるのは、あくまであなた自身だ。最後の追悼式典が終わったそのとき、ミンフィリアの声がリンクパール越しに届く。ちょうど式典が終わった頃合いかと冗談めかしながらも、グランドカンパニーの使者たちをいつまでも待たせるわけにはいかない以上、早く「砂の家」に戻ってほしいと頼み込むのだった。</p>
      <p>あなたが再び「砂の家」の応接室に足を踏み入れると、ミンフィリアは「お帰りなさい」と微笑みかけ、三人の指導者の演説は期待どおりの示唆に富むものだったかと尋ねる。彼女の言うとおり、どの国家もそれぞれ固有の問題を抱えており、蛮族や蛮神、帝国軍、内紛といった数々の脅威に苛まれている。その中で、あなたのような冒険者が求められているのは当然のことだろう。もっと多くのあなたのような存在がいてくれればと、ミンフィリアは本音を漏らしつつも、その期待があなた一人の肩に重くのしかかっていることも理解している。彼女は、しばし旅の疲れを癒やし、じっくりと考えを整理したうえで、グランドカンパニーの使者たちに返事をしてほしいと促す。先にも述べたように、グランドカンパニーは自らの国家を守ることを第一とし、「暁の血盟」はエオルゼア全体の未来を見据えて動く組織だ。目的は似ているようでありながら、その視座は必ずしも同じではない。とはいえ、ミンフィリアはなおも、あなたがいずれかのグランドカンパニーに所属することを強く勧める。あなたほどの力は、善きことにも悪しきことにも用いられうるゆえに、必ずしも友好的とは限らない目を引き寄せてしまう。一人でどれほど警戒を怠らずにいても限界はあるが、組織の中に身を置き、多くの仲間に囲まれていれば、その功績も危険も皆で分かち合うことができる。そのうえで、グランドカンパニーに加わることは「暁」を去ることを意味しないと念を押し、これからもあなたの力に頼ることになるだろうと明言する。エオルゼアは変わりつつあり、その行く末を形作る力をあなたは持っているのだと、彼女は真摯な眼差しで告げる。明日何が起こるか誰にも分からない。だが、自分自身と仲間を信じ続けるかぎり、成し遂げられないことなどないはずだと、ミンフィリアはあなたを励ますのだった。</p>
      <p>一方その頃、ウルダハの「クイックサンド」では、別の会話が交わされていた。人々が去り、祭りの喧噪が徐々に薄れていく酒場の片隅で、アルフィノとアリゼーは先ほどの演説を振り返っている。アルフィノは、あなたがどの「グランド」カンパニーを選ぶのかは神のみぞ知るところだが、それとは無関係に歴史の歯車は動き出していると、どこか愉快そうに語る。しかし、アリゼーはあまり満足していない様子だ。彼女は、追悼式典と称しながら、実際には旗を振り上げるための集会にすぎず、第七霊災や第七霊災期の惨状についてほとんど語られなかったことを痛烈に批判する。アルフィノは、その「黙殺」こそが意図的なものだと指摘する。エオルゼアに刻まれた傷はあまりにも深く、いまだ流血は止まっていない。そこへ蛮族や蛮神が追い打ちをかけている以上、過去の惨劇を語るだけでは傷を癒やすことはできない。だからこそ、「暁の血盟」とグランドカンパニーの協力によって、現実の傷口を塞ぐために動かねばならないのだと、彼は妹に諭す。だがアリゼーは、都合よく歴史を書き換える支配者たちに世界の命運を預けるつもりはないと強く反論し、エオルゼアを蝕む病を癒やす、別の道を必ず見つけてみせると誓う。アルフィノは、進む道こそ違えど、目指す目的地は同じだと穏やかに答え、いずれは互いの考えが一致するときが来ると信じていると告げる。そのとき、護衛が慌てた様子でアリゼーに声をかけ、彼女を護送する段取りが整ったことを告げる。アルフィノは、「希望の有無ではなく、共に背負う宿命がある」と言い切り、二人が共に立つか、共に倒れるかのどちらかであると締めくくる。癒やしの「薬」は現在の傷を塞ぐだけでなく、過去に刻まれた古い傷が再び開かぬようにするものでなければならない──そう呟きながら、兄妹はそれぞれの道へと歩み出していくのだった。</p>

    story:`<div class="clamp" data-collapsed="true">
      <p>在 The Waking Sands 的會議室裡，Minfilia 迎接你的歸來，目光溫柔卻也認真，回顧你至今走過的軌跡。不久之前，你還只是 Eorzea 無數冒險者中的一員，在這片大地上摸索自己的方向。然而憑藉你的品格與勇氣，你被託付 Envoy 的重任，踏遍各地，為有需要的人伸出援手，從未考慮回報。這些行動讓 Y’shtola 相信，若能得到你的力量，「Scions of the Seventh Dawn」勢必受益良多。你加入組織後不久，便親自面對蛮神 Ifrit，並取得勝利。短短時間內，你完成了許多驚人的壯舉，也因此贏得名聲。Minfilia 卻提醒你，名聲從來不是沒有代價的。她話音剛落，便有客人造訪──與其說是來找 Scions，不如說是專程為了你而來的三人：分別代表 Gridania 的 Order of the Twin Adder、Ul’dah 的 Immortal Flames，以及 Limsa Lominsa 的 Maelstrom。這些 Grand Company 的軍官一一向你行禮，極盡讚美之詞，強調你的事蹟如何鼓舞人心，並熱情邀請你加入他們的旗幟之下。Minfilia 說明，Grand Company 在平時並不會為了一位新兵做到這種程度，這次之所以破例，就表示他們對你的評價有多高。她向你解釋 Grand Company 的本質──在國家面臨危機時，負責統籌軍事、經濟與技術資源的綜合組織。選擇效力某個 Grand Company，就是選擇為那個國家服務，保護它、推進它的理想，同時也能獲得各式各樣的回報與支援。她強調，今天的選擇並非終身無法變更，但也絕不是可以輕率決定的小事。為了幫助你更清楚地了解三方的立場，她建議你前往即將舉辦的 Remembrance Services，親耳聽聽各 Grand Company 首領的演說，讓自己做出更有根據的判斷。在你啟程前，她將一枚 linkpearl 放進你手中，讓 Scions 無論身在何處都能與你保持聯繫，同時再度勸你認真考慮加入某個 Grand Company──不是要限制你的自由，而是希望你這股強大的力量，能與同伴共享戰果與風險，而不是孤身一人承受。</p>
      <p>你接著找上 Tataru，想更清楚地了解接下來的安排。她先是有些不好意思地承認，現在外界對你的熱烈關注，可能有一部分是她惹出來的──她把你的事蹟說得太多、太大聲，傳到太多人耳裡了。為此她連忙保證，下次會謹言慎行，必要時甚至會「真的」把自己的舌頭按住，才開始說明 Remembrance Services 的細節。如果一切順利，第一場追悼儀式會在 Gridania 由 Order of the Twin Adder 主辦，Elder Seedseer Kan-E-Senna 將在 Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre 發表演說。接著你得前往 Ul’dah，在 Royal Promenade 聆聽 Flame General Raubahn Aldynn 的演說，據說現場還會出現特別來賓。最後，你將造訪 Limsa Lominsa，在 Stateroom 參加由 Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn 主持的儀式。那個房間必須透過 Admiral’s Lift 進入，到場時向守衛 Zanthael 表明身分，他就會放你通行。Tataru 坦言，為了集合這麼多重要人物，行程順序有可能臨時變動，但除此之外也沒有更好的辦法，因此她建議你還是以 Gridania 為起點。你遵照她的建議，先來到綠意環繞的 Gridania，在 Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre 與眾多居民一同抬頭仰望舞台。人群之中，有人低聲談論自己在 Calamity 中失去的親人，也有人讚嘆三位 Seedseer 難得齊聚一堂。當 Kan-E-Senna 站上前方，背後是象徵 Hyur 與 Elezen 團結的雙蛇旗幟，她開始講述這座森林之城的歷史：先民如何因畏懼 greenwrath 而躲進地底，卻仍渴望有朝一日能沐浴在樹影斑駁的陽光之下；又如何透過不懈努力，贏得 elementals 的認可，被允許在樹蔭之下築城。Hyur 與 Elezen 攜手播下文明的種子，隨著時間推移，各族人民陸續加入，在 unity 的泉水與 Matron 的光芒滋養之下，Gridania 才成長為今日的樣貌。她也沒有迴避現實中較為陰暗的一面：依循 elementals 意志而選擇和平，並不代表從未上過戰場。在 Garlean Empire 將戰火帶入 Eorzea 時，他們同樣在 Twin Adder 的旗幟下集結，與盟友一起迎戰。五年前的 Carteneau 戰役與 Calamity 帶來了沉重的犧牲，無數 Gridanian 在那天倒下，森林至今仍留著傷痕。災後的黑衣森林面臨內憂外患：有人民因絕望而踏上 banditry、poaching 等不義之路，也有 Ixal 借機變本加厲，不斷襲擊邊境，加上 sylph 當中逐漸浮現的微妙變化，使得 unity 變得格外脆弱。即便如此，Kan-E-Senna 仍以溫柔而堅定的語氣呼籲眾人，不要只是用言語與回憶來紀念戰死者，而要以集體行動回應他們的犧牲──再一次在 Twin Adder 的旗幟下攜手，修復森林的創傷，讓後代能再度在這些古老樹木之下，過著 harmony 的生活。</p>
      <p>儀式結束，人潮逐漸散去時，一對年輕的雙胞胎悄悄走向你。男孩自我介紹為 Alphinaud，身旁是他的妹妹 Alisaie，他們稱自己是「歷史的學生」，正在巡迴各地參加這些 Remembrance Services，以追求某種更深的「enlightenment」。不久之後，在較為安靜的角落裡，Alphinaud 向你解說 Gridania 當前的局勢。這座城市同時面對兩個 beast tribe：好戰的 Ixal，經常召喚渴求鮮血的 primal Garuda；以及本性較為頑皮、而非惡意的 sylph，他們過去一直與 Gridania 保持友好，卻在召喚 primal Ramuh 之後逐漸變得疏遠。Gridania 的人民不喜歡戰爭，總是把 open conflict 視為最後手段；與 Ixal 的頻繁衝突主要是出於 self-defense，而與 sylph 的關係則由一紙 peace treaty 勉強維繫。Calamity 使 Twelveswood 受到重創，elementals 的力量也受到削弱，這片森林反而成了 Gridania 的弱點。居民們期望透過長期的復育，使森林重新恢復活力，從而終結這些困境──但那可能是以世紀為單位的漫長工程。與此同時，受到 Garuda 煽動的 Ixal 仍一再發動 incursions，遲早會把 Gridania 推向全面 war 的邊緣。Alphinaud 認為，無論 Gridania 願不願意，這一天終會到來，屆時 Order of the Twin Adder 必須集結一切能夠得到的力量。在那樣的未來裡，一位經驗豐富的冒險者，如你這般，將會有多重要──他沒有明說，只是在話語的末尾留下一絲意味深長的停頓。</p>
      <p>隨後，你動身前往 Ul’dah。Royal Promenade 上擠滿了人群，大家一邊喃喃說著「是 Sultana Nanamo 本人」，一邊期待地眺望遠處的階梯。當 Flame General Raubahn Aldynn 與 Nanamo Ul Namo 一同現身時，廣場宛如燃燒起來。Raubahn 高舉手臂，向「被沙漠懷抱、由火焰牽引而來的靈魂」高聲呼喊，提醒眾人 Ul 王朝如何自古以來在這片荒蕪之地將 sand 化為 gold，在 Nald’thal 的 grace 與 glory 庇護之下，培養出今天的富庶。Alphinaud 低聲向你指出，Raubahn 背後那面 Immortal Flames 的軍旗，其 emblem 上的 golden scales 象徵秩序，一端托著 prosperity 的寶石，另一端承載 might 的火焰。Raubahn 接著提起 Carteneau 的血戰，強調當時在 blood 與 gold 方面，沒有任何國家比 Ul’dah 付出更多，也正因如此，第 VII 軍團才得以被擊潰。他為那些永遠無法踏出城門、再也回不到這片沙之都的同胞祈禱，希望他們能作為 Thal 的 honored guests，在另一端獲得幸福。然而，Raubahn 並未藉著這份回憶自我陶醉，反而把話鋒一轉，直指現實。Calamity 過後的五年間，過去支撐人民的犧牲精神逐漸消散，取而代之的是一個高度分裂的社會：富人與窮人之間鴻溝加深，Monetarist 與 Royalist 相互牽制，各方勢力為自身利益斤斤計較。外有 Amalj’aa 在道路旁虎視眈眈，扼住貿易命脈；Garlean Empire 在邊境試探，奪取土地資源；大量難民湧入，使得 Ul’dah 面臨無法長久維持的壓力。Raubahn 問道：「這樣的景象，真的是當年同胞用性命換來的國家嗎？」對於那些把這種苟延殘喘稱作「活著」的人，他毫不客氣地斥為是在玷污 Immortal Flames 的名號，只是在走向「緩慢的死亡」。他的解法，是再次喚起 unity 與責任感：不要只顧著填滿自己的 coffers，而是要將力量與資源投向 Immortal Flames，投向 Ul’dah 本身。不要只想著能從這個國家搶到什麼，而要思考如何讓整個 Eorzea 與 Ul’dah 一同再度繁榮。當他呼籲大家在 sultana 之名下團結時，人群隨之沸騰。這時 Nanamo 自己走上前來，表示那些以 coins 與 carats 衡量 Ul’dah wealth 的人，犯了嚴重的錯誤。真正的富饒，存在於人民的 health、happiness 與 hopes 之中。她請大家一同舉起 Ul’dah 的 torch，讓這團 flame 成為照亮 Eorzea 的 beacon。群眾高喊「Long live Nanamo！」，Raubahn 則以「For Victory and Fortune！」作結，呼籲所有人無懼火焰，因為唯有經歷烈焰，才能迎接重生。</p>
      <p>儀式之後，Alphinaud 再度出現在你身旁，為你補上 Ul’dah 背後的故事。他說，Ul’dah 與 worship Ifrit 的 Amalj’aa 之間，有著漫長且血腥的衝突歷史。從你臉上的神情來看，他猜想你多半已經親自見識過那些沙漠部族的殘暴。Ul’dahn 不會逃避 confrontation，一旦有人威脅到他們珍視的 prosperity，他們就會選擇正面 crush 掉威脅。過去，他們一次又一次以武力 smother Ifrit 的 flames，只要 Amalj’aa 召喚，他們就派軍隊討伐。但這只是問題的一部分。Garlean Empire 雖然在過去五年相對沉默，卻從未真正消失，隨時準備再度出手；難民仍然以驚人的速度湧入，而就算 sultanate 的 coffers 再深，也總會有耗盡的一天。資源是有限的。另一方面，Amalj’aa 召喚 Ifrit 的頻率正在提升，每一次召喚，Immortal Flames 都必須派兵制止，而每一次勝利都要付出 blood 的代價。這是一場無法無限持續的 war of attrition。於是，不難理解為何 Immortal Flames 如此積極地想要招募新成員。對他們而言，在這樣的時刻得到一位像你這樣、經歷過真正戰場的冒險者，是極大的鼓舞。Alphinaud 在最後說道，他只希望 Flame General 的演說，能在你心中留下某種共鳴──不論你最終做出什麼選擇。</p>
      <p>接下來，你抵達 Limsa Lominsa。Admiral’s Lift 前的 Zanthael 告訴你，如果要參加 Remembrance Service，就得快些，因為 Admiral 隨時會開始演說。你搭乘升降機來到 Stateroom，海水的氣息與嘈雜討論聲充滿整個空間。Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn 站在眾人面前，向「來自大海的兄弟姊妹」高聲呼籲，請大家抬頭望向那面 mighty crimson standard，讓 pride 在心中燃起。群眾立刻以海盜式的吶喊回應。Merlwyb 提醒大家，自從祖先在這片肥沃的海灣擱淺，七百個夏天已經過去。在 Navigator 的引導下，Limsa Lominsa 從 humble 的漁村成長為統御五海乃至更遠之地的 maritime nation。Alphinaud 在你耳邊說明，那片 crimson field 象徵倒下船員的鮮血，而黑色 longship 則是曾經稱霸海上的 pirate vessel。當 Garlean Empire 向 Eorzea 發動戰爭時，Limsa Lominsa 再次在 Maelstrom 的旗幟下重整軍隊，從 Knights of the Barracuda 到各大海盜團，包括 Hyllfyr’s Bloody Executioners 在內，全都響應號召，來到 Carteneau 的戰場。一如 Merlwyb 所說，那一天，全世界都見識到了 Limsa Lominsa united 的力量。然而代價是沉重的，許多海員再也沒能回到港灣。她要大家一同默禱，願這群為 freedom 而犧牲的人，其靈魂得以歸返大海。接著，她把話題轉向 Calamity 之後的五年──rebuilding 從未停歇，但許多傷口至今仍在潰爛。Sahagin 為了滿足其 accursed god Leviathan 的要求，不斷上岸尋找 blood；來自 O’Ghomoro 的 kobolds 則不斷向南推進，以 Titan 之名侵蝕土地。這些 beast tribe 只是第一波浪潮，背後還有 Garlean Empire 的 grim tide 正在聚集。帝國的旗幟已經在 Limsa 領海附近飄揚，隨時都可能發動新的攻勢。更糟糕的是，國內各派 pirate 之間血海深仇不斷，內部 mutiny 的氣息濃得彷彿隨時會引爆。Merlwyb 直言，在這樣的狀況下，若不先 mend the rift，這艘名為 Limsa Lominsa 的 ship 只會被浪濤撕裂。她以女海盜式的強悍語氣宣告，只剩下一條路可以走：修補 Calamity 再度撕開的裂痕，讓 pirates 與 Maelstrom 站在同一陣線，與 adventurers 肩並肩對抗 beast tribe 與 Empire。她警告大家，沒有 unity 的 crew，只是一群註定溺死的人。於是她張開雙臂，呼喚所有「海上的兄弟姊妹」聚集在這面 undying crimson standard 之下，奉上自己的 strength、skill 與 wisdom，在 Navigator 的指引下，讓這艘 ship 一直駛向遠方，直到 sea swallows all。室內隨即爆發出「Long live the Admiral！」之類的吼聲，甚至有人高喊要立刻去準備 cutlass，誓言要跟隨她「到七重地獄的最深處」。</p>
      <p>會後，Alphinaud 又一次在較為安靜的空間攔住你，說明 Limsa Lominsa 所面對的壓力。正如 Admiral 在演說中提到的，這座城市同時受到兩個 beast tribe 的威脅：魚一般的 Sahagin 崇拜 primal Leviathan，而地底的 kobolds 則以 primal Titan 為神。除此之外，Garlean Empire 還在這片海域後方架設了 fortress，把兵力硬生生插入 Limsa 的 backyard。更不用說身為 pirate nation 所帶來的內部衝突：各個 pirate 派系之間的 blood feud 無止無休，讓 city–state 很難把注意力集中在真正的外敵身上。若 Limsa 想要抵抗 Empire，第一步就必須先處理 internal strife，把這些差異擱置一旁，然後徹底解決 primal threat。正因如此，他預期 Maelstrom 不久後必然會針對 beast tribe 發動 decisive action，那面軍旗恐怕會被染上更深一層的 crimson。對這樣的未來而言，你這樣的 capable adventurer 若願意加入，無疑是莫大的助力。然而你是否會決定與 Admiral 一同乘風破浪，這並非任何演說可以替你做主。就在你思索之際，linkpearl 裡響起 Minfilia 的聲音，她語帶笑意地說，最後一場 Remembrance Service 應該剛結束沒多久吧。玩笑過後，她提醒你，那三位 Grand Company 軍官仍在 Waking Sands 等待你的回覆。儘管 Scions 很高興能在自家據點招待他們，但也不能讓對方無止境地乾等下去，因此請你儘快返回。</p>
      <p>你再次踏入 Waking Sands 的 Solar，Minfilia 露出安心的微笑，詢問那些領袖的演說是否真的像你期望的那樣具有啟發性。你很清楚，各個 nation 雖然面臨的問題各不相同，卻同樣被 beast tribe、primal、Garlean 的野心、內部政治矛盾所困擾，也難怪你的力量會成為眾人爭相拉攏的對象。她坦白說，真希望世界上能多幾個像你這樣的冒險者，但同時也明白，這樣的期望對你來說會是一種負擔。因此她建議你先暫時休息，讓自己從長途旅程中緩一口氣，再慢慢思考要把 loyalty 托付給哪個 Grand Company。她再一次提醒你，加入某個 Grand Company 就是選擇為那個 nation 奮鬥，替它守護國境、推動其理想；Scions 則是以整個 Eorzea 的未來為念，兩者雖然相近，卻並非完全相同。即便如此，她仍舊認為，以你現在所擁有的力量，置身 Grand Company 之中會比獨自一人更加安全。你的 power 會吸引各式各樣的注視，其中不是每一雙眼睛都抱持善意；就算你再怎麼 vigilant，你終究是「一個人」。然而身在 Grand Company 之中，你就會是眾多人當中的一個，是眾多 friends 當中的一員，成就與危險都將由大家共同承擔。她也特別強調，加入 Grand Company 並不代表要離開 Scions，未來他們仍會不斷向你尋求幫助，因為在前方等待的戰鬥，只會比現在更加艱難。Minfilia 看著你說，Eorzea 正在改變，而你擁有讓這個世界「重新塑形」的力量。沒有人能預言 tomorrow 會發生什麼事，但只要你持續相信自己與身邊的同伴，就沒有任何目標是完全無法達成的。</p>
      <p>遠離 Waking Sands 的寧靜，在 Ul’dah 熱鬧的酒館 The Quicksand 裡，另一段對話正悄然展開。Alphinaud 與 Alisaie 在角落看著人潮變少，討論著你剛剛參加過的那一連串 Remembrance Ceremonies。Alphinaud 帶著一絲玩味地說，只有 gods 才知道你最終會選擇哪一家「Grand」 Company，但不管如何，change 的齒輪已經開始轉動。Alisaie 卻並不買帳，她直言這些所謂的「Remembrance」根本只是標準的 standard-waving rally，只是在揮舞旗幟、煽動情緒，對於 Calamity 與 Seventh Umbral Era 的真正恐怖幾乎隻字未提。Alphinaud 則指出，那並不是遺忘，而是 deliberate omission。Calamity 留下的 wounds 深不見底，Eorzea 至今仍在流血；beast tribe 與 primal 更是不斷往傷口上撒鹽。在這樣的情況下，單純回顧過去、沉浸在哀悼之中，並不能真正治癒任何東西。因此，他認為 Scions of the Seventh Dawn 必須與 Grand Company 合作，試圖為這片大地敷上一層真正的 salve，讓現實的傷口逐步癒合。Alisaie 卻強烈反對把整個 realm 的命運交給那些會為了自身方便而 rewrite history 的「despots」。她相信一定還有另一條道路，能重新醫治這個世界，她決心要親自去尋找。Alphinaud 接受她的意見，表示他不否認道路可能不同，但 destination 卻是一樣的，總有一天兩人會在看法上達成共識。就在這時，一名護衛匆匆前來，稱呼 Alisaie 為「M’lady」，表示護送的安排已經就緒。Alphinaud 最後說，這並不是單純依靠 hope 的問題，而是兩人共同背負的 fate──要嘛一起成功，要嘛一起失敗。他相信，他們所追求的 salve，不僅要縫合現存的傷口，還得防止那些古老的傷疤再次被撕裂。說罷，兄妹倆便在喧鬧的人聲背後，踏上各自的道路，而 Eorzea 的未來，也在悄然間朝著未知的方向前行。</p>
