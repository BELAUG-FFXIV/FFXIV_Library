    story:`<div class="clamp" data-collapsed="true">
<p>Back at the new “gazebo” in Idyllshire, Cyr watches Gigi proudly present his freshly painted family crest and cannot shake the feeling that something is wrong. The old woman from Ishgard has clearly followed you all this way, he mutters; she is involved somehow, the only question is how. Nashu, oblivious to the tension, claps her hands and declares that Gigi is just as talented as his grandpapa. Julyan, arms folded and gaze sharp, grumbles that even if she were willing to turn a blind eye to her son’s foolishness, this ramshackle utopia is no place to raise a child. Gigi, however, only cares about his work: he beams and asks how everyone likes his family crest, then hastily corrects himself when he nearly blurts out “Grandpapa Godbert and Gra─” and instead calls Julyan “m’lady.” Later, as the day wears on, Hildibrand yawns and admits that even a gentleman’s stamina has limits, and he could do with a spot of tea. Nashu tugs his sleeve and points across the way: two figures have been staring at them for several minutes. Hildibrand assumes they are overawed fans, too nervous to approach their idol in the flesh and ready to flee at the slightest provocation. Cyr—ever the realist—snaps that perhaps, just perhaps, they are the Grand Sers themselves, and when the two figures turn to leave he shouts and gives chase. Gigi flails an arm and calls out that they went to the right, urging everyone to go on ahead; he will catch up soon, he promises.</p>
<p>You pursue the quarry all the way to the Answering Quarter in the Dravanian hinterlands, where Cyr collapses in a huffing, puffing heap and curses the Fury. He has not run like that, he wheezes, since Ser Charibert chased him up and down the Steps of Faith with a flaming weapon. Julyan only snorts that sparing the rod spoils the milksop, while Nashu peers about, wondering where those two old men—and Gigi—have gone. Hildibrand, undeterred, strides into the open and loudly commands the “dastardly rapscallions” to reveal themselves. In answer, two elderly men leap forward with absurdly grandiose introductions: Orland, slayer of a thousand thousand wyrms, the silver spear that pierced the very heavens; and Gonspart, master of magicks ancient and awesome, wielder of a divine hand that has cured every ill save age and incontinence. They shout “Grand Sers, excelsior!” in chorus, leaving Cyr unsure whether to laugh or cry. Hildibrand—momentarily tripped up by the word “grandsires”—recovers and formally accuses them of convincing young Ishgardian maidens to attend private parties under false pretenses, inflicting terrible financial and emotional distress. As inspector extraordinaire, he announces, he has come on behalf of these poor innocents to ensure no others suffer as they did, and orders the pair to lay down their arms and surrender. Instead, Orland bellows about audacity, vows that you will rue this day, and charges off in a rush of nostalgic battle fervor—only to overdo it and send himself hurtling into a dramatic, painful fall that leaves him “mostly dead.” Cyr, having seen such near-fatal antics far too recently, declares that with haste the old man might yet be saved, and points to Gonspart, the supposed master of magicks. The aged mage squints, finally realizes Cyr is addressing him, and begins a series of long, meandering incantations—first to summon a creature of the abyss, then to conjure a vortex of biting winds to smite his foes—prompting Cyr to shout that these are supposed to be his friends. The chaos is cut short when Dorys steps from the shadows holding Gigi hostage and commands everyone to stand down. Hildibrand cries out in shock, Cyr recognizes her as the woman who has been shadowing you since Ishgard, and Dorys introduces herself in equally melodramatic fashion as a “midnight shadow” who bears fair and fearsome faces. She mocks you for thinking such disguises would fool no one, then points out that you have walked straight into their trap. All their parties and petty schemes, she reveals, were merely preparation; their true objective from the beginning was the mammet.</p>
<p>When the smoke clears—literally and figuratively—the Grand Sers and Dorys have withdrawn with painful slowness, taking Gigi with them. Cyr coughs and curses that he can barely see, then dryly observes that, for all the drama, the villains are only retreating at an adamantoise’s pace. Hildibrand, however, is consumed with guilt. He laments that in his eagerness to seize the Grand Sers, he failed to grasp their true aim until it was too late, and now his beloved son is in their clutches. What if he never sees Gigi again? Nashu, ever dramatic in her own way, suggests they must be halfway to Radz–at–Han by now, but Cyr rejects the notion with a sigh; even fleeing, their pursuers are hardly swift. Julyan cuts through the noise, calling for everyone to get moving and chase down “the old buggers.” Her use of “milksop” for Cyr unexpectedly stirs memories of his mentor, who used to hurl that same insult at him among many others. Straightening, Cyr insists they must not act rashly. If the kidnappers realize they are being followed, they may attempt to flee again—very slowly, perhaps, but flee nonetheless. Nashu wonders aloud if their quarry is asleep or just resting their eyes somewhere ahead, and Julyan, catching your look, explains that there is a time to crack skulls and a time to let an idiot son deal with his own troubles. For now, she will watch and wait. Not far away, in the undergrowth, Orland, Dorys, and Gonspart skulk along, jumping at every rustle: Orland insists that death stalks them at every turn, Dorys snaps that it is only passersby, and Gonspart mumbles incoherently, betraying nerves frayed by age, exhaustion, and the weight of their scheme.</p>
<p>Eventually, the merry little procession slows near an old ruin by Saint Mocianne’s Arboretum, where the Grand Sers make camp. From a hidden vantage, Hildibrand surveys the scene and notes that, in a sense, the Grand Sers have once more been caught by the very inspector who was trying to catch them. Cyr agrees on the irony but points out that they still have Gigi, which makes celebrating premature. Frustrated, he wishes aloud for an opportunity—any opportunity—to shift the balance. That thought gives him an idea: they could ambush the dozing dragoon, take him hostage, and demand an exchange. Hildibrand is appalled. A gentleman, he declares, cannot condone the violent kidnapping and ransom of his elders. They must approach this problem as paragons of honor and virtue. His alternative, however, makes Cyr’s eye twitch: rather than hold the old dragoon hostage, you will stalk and subdue him, then relieve him of his armor so that Hildibrand can don a disguise. Cyr protests that stripping an old man naked can hardly be called more gentlemanly than taking him prisoner, but Hildibrand assures him that all will be revealed in time and urges you onward with blithe confidence in Mandervillian guile.</p>
<p>Following the inspector’s dubious plan, you approach Orland’s post alone. The old dragoon startles, then peers at you in confusion. There is something awfully familiar about you, he says—those muscular forearms, those strong yet tender-looking fingers. He promptly asks you to massage his shoulders, complaining of lingering aches that even Gonspart’s magicks cannot soothe. When you explain that you must remove his breastplate to do so properly, he readily agrees and asks for help with the straps. As you work, he relaxes and declares you a saint, reminiscing that it is the little things one learns to appreciate with age and that his late wife used to help him out of his armor. He settles himself more comfortably to receive your “tender ministrations,” then rambles about wishing he had a tincture of salamander to rub on his chest and under his nose to help him sleep, as his dear “pigsney” once did. Under your careful hands, his eyes slip shut; his breathing slows, then stutters into soft snores. For a moment the sound stops, and you fear you have just witnessed his final moments. Leaning in, you extend a hesitant finger, only to jerk back when a sudden twitch announces the return of labored breathing. Taking this as your chance, you remove Orland’s sabatons and breeches with the utmost care, leaving him snoring, half-naked, and utterly vulnerable to nearby bears and morbols. The system’s sardonic blessing—may he rest in peace—rings in your ears as you retreat with his armor.</p>
<p>Returning to the Answering Quarter, you present the armor to Hildibrand, who greets you as his stalwart assistant and asks if you have treated the dragoon with all due courtesy befitting a man of his years while acquiring the necessary equipment. Pleased with your “success,” he declares that he will disguise himself as Orland and infiltrate the villains’ midst to free Gigi from captivity. Cyr, staring at the inspector’s face and build, protests that the two look nothing alike and that, whatever their age, the conspirators are not blind. Hildibrand simply smiles and tells him to have faith; he is about to witness a magnificent display of Mandervillian disguise work. At the camp, Gonspart frets about dinner and asks if it is time to eat again, only for Dorys to snap that they have just eaten and demand to know where Orland has disappeared to. She grumbles that she knows the old man must relieve himself constantly, but this is excessive even for him. At that moment, Hildibrand strides into camp wearing the purloined armor and greets them as “fellow antediluvians,” declaring his return. Cyr, watching from afar, mutters a despairing oath, but Dorys apparently accepts the disguise at face value, complaining only that he took his time. She orders everyone to pack up so they can be back on the road within ten minutes. Hildibrand insists that before they leave, they must first release young Gigi; keeping a child in a cage is unbecoming of a gentleman. Dorys shouts that he is talking nonsense and that the boy is going to get away, but Hildibrand calmly points out that Gigi is still right here under his care. On a completely unrelated note, he says, he will now be taking the boy with him on a brief sojourn into the wilderness. Cyr can barely contain himself: against all logic, the plan is working. Hildibrand is about to walk out with Gigi and they seem willing to let him go.</p>
<p>The moment of triumph is cut short when a shivering, armorless Orland stumbles out of the woods muttering about the cold and being chased by morbols. Seeing his double in full armor, he decides that he must be dying, that his life is flashing before his eyes, and that he will soon be reunited with his beloved pigsney. Dorys, however, sees only an impostor and explodes with rage that anyone would dare try such a hackneyed ruse. As Orland wails about how much dying hurts, Hildibrand seizes the opening and urges Gigi to run with him. Dorys stops them with a single word: “Vivi, wait!” Something in Gigi jolts. He repeats the name, struggling to remember where he has heard it before. Dorys presses on, telling him to remember who and what he really is: Vivi, a creation of the great Sharlayan archmagus Quan. The half-recovered mammet stammers the name again and again—Quan, Quan—and suddenly the memories return. He recalls being given life, being cared for and raised by Grandpapa Quan, living together and learning about the outside world. For a moment his voice softens with the warmth of those days…then cracks as he remembers the end. Grandpapa Quan abandoned him. The archmagus deemed him flawed, Dorys explains, believing that Vivi lacked the power to turn back the hands of time and restore his youth. In disappointment and ignorance he cast Vivi out and later died alone.</p>
<p>Cyr, stunned, latches onto one phrase: to turn back the hands of time. He realizes that the power Gigi used in the Crozier to restore the duke’s shattered vase could, in theory, be applied to people as well. But how do these three know all this? They could not possibly have been Quan’s colleagues. Dorys answers before he can ask: they found the archmagus’s journals during one of their many expeditions into the Great Library. Long ago they were famed heroes of Ishgard’s wars, wealthy champions with fortunes to match. But no soldier can triumph over time. Little by little, victory gave way to age, and in the end Ishgard no longer had need of their services. They came to Idyllshire to scrape by as relic hunters, doing what they knew best until their bodies failed them. Then, amidst the dust and tomes of the Great Library, they discovered the opportunity of a second lifetime: records of a mammet capable of taking that which is broken and restoring it to its prime state, of wielding temporal magicks that could rewind time itself and give them back their misspent youth. With the journals as a guide, they deduced that Vivi lay somewhere in the western highlands; their second chance was almost at hand—until they had to watch you pluck the mammet from the snow and take him away, nearly ruining everything. Now, Dorys calls out to him with renewed fervor. If he comes with them, they will help him unlock his true potential. Imagine what might be possible: he could make them young again, and perhaps even restore life to Archmagus Quan. Vivi’s voice becomes a jagged mechanical cry as he exclaims nonsense syllables, torn between wonder and fear. Cyr recoils, declaring that no magick can truly return the dead. At best, one can animate a corpse, and the precepts are clear: the products of necromancy are abominations in the eyes of the Fury. Hildibrand, desperate, reminds Gigi of their adventures, of their beloved gazebo, and of his Manderville identity. He is a Manderville mammet, the inspector insists. Gigi’s response is gentle but firm. Papa Hildy has always been kind to him, and he will be grateful forever—but it was Grandpapa Quan who made him, and he misses him. Even if the attempt fails, he says, he has to try. He turns away and follows Dorys and the Grand Sers.</p>
<p>Cyr shouts that you must stop them, but Hildibrand hesitates. For a moment he murmurs that perhaps they should respect Gigi’s decision, only to then realize he cannot abide the thought of his son using temporal magicks to twist the natural order. He thinks back to his own life, to the decision he once made to become a traveling inspector and how stubbornly he has clung to it. Perhaps Gigi’s resolve is a reflection of that same Manderville stubbornness. Even so, Hildibrand suddenly snaps that he is Gigi’s father and cannot simply stand aside. It falls to him to ensure that the boy keeps to the righteous path and, if he must raise the dead, uses only “traditional methods of zombification.” Straightening, he thanks Cyr for his dedication and all he has done, but warns that if they continue as they have—pursuing and cornering the old conspirators—Gigi may be driven to reckless action. Thus he asks the inquisitor to suspend his pursuit of the Grand Sers for a time so that he, as a father, might have a chance to persuade his son to return peacefully. Cyr considers this, then concedes that, given how little they know about the full extent of Gigi’s powers, it would indeed be dangerous to act aggressively should the mammet choose to wield them. Hildibrand beams, declaring that he knew Cyr would understand. There is no time to waste; he calls Nashu and Julyan back to their new “gazebo” to plan their next move. Julyan, half exasperated and half impressed, mutters that it would have been a shame if he had given up that easily—though it does mean she must stick around longer. On the other hand, if that bloody mammet really can make people young again…well, the thought brings a glint to her eye.</p>
<p>True to his word, Cyr suspends his pursuit of the Grand Sers—but he does not abandon the case. He returns to Ishgard and greets you in the Foundation aetheryte plaza, explaining that the inquisition maintains an extensive collection of heretical tomes, including many of Sharlayan origin. He intends to scour them for any information on temporal magicks. This is, of course, he says, strictly for the purpose of confirming the mammet’s heretical origins—nothing more. When he catches the look you give him, as if to suggest that his interest might be a touch more personal than professional, he flusters and insists he has no idea what you are not talking about. With a brisk nod, he thanks you for your help and formally dismisses you, leaving the questions of Gigi’s powers—and his fate—hanging in the air like an unanswered prayer to the Fury.</p>

<p>イディルシャイアの「新しい東屋」にて、ギギが誇らしげに描き上げた家紋を披露する中、シルはどうにも胸のざわめきを抑えきれずにいた。あの老女は、イシュガルドからここまでつけてきたに違いない……彼女が一枚噛んでいるのは明らかだが、問題はその「関わり方」だと、彼は低く呟く。一方ナシュは、そんな空気にはまったく気づかない様子で、ギギの腕前に目を輝かせ、「おじいちゃん譲りの才能ですよ！」と盛大に褒め称える。ジュリアンは腕を組んで周囲を見回し、「息子のバカ騒ぎに目をつぶるにしたって、こんな場所が子どもを育てるのに向いてるとは思えないね」と渋い顔だ。肝心のギギは、自分の作品の出来栄えばかりが気になるらしい。「ぼくの家紋、どうかな？」と嬉しそうに尋ねかけ、つい勢いで「グランパ・ゴッドベルトとグラ──」と言いかけて、あわてて「レディ・ジュリアン」と言い直すのだった。やがて日も傾き、ヒルディブランドが大きな欠伸をしながら、「悲しいかな、紳士の体力にも限りがある……そろそろお茶でも飲みたいところだ」とぼやいていると、ナシュが袖を引いて、向こうからじっとこちらを見つめている二人組に気づかせる。ヒルディブランドは、自分の崇拝者なら珍しくもない行動だろうと気楽に受け流し、「偶像を前にすると、会いたさと恐れのあまり逃げ出してしまうファンも多いものだ」と言って笑う。しかしシルは苛立ちを隠さず、「もしかして、いやほとんど間違いなく、あれが“グランド・サー”だろう」と声を荒げる。二人組が踵を返したのを見て、彼は「逃がすな」と叫び、一同は慌てて追走を開始する。ギギは慌てて腕を振り回し、「あっち！　右だよ！」と進行方向を指し示し、「ぼくはすぐ追いつくから、みんなは先に行って！」と叫んで皆を送り出すのだった。</p>
<p>追跡の果て、一行はドラヴァニア高地「アンサリング・クォーター」にたどり着く。シルは肩で息をしながら、ハルオーネに悪態をつき、セリ・シャリベールに燃え盛る武器を構えて「信仰」を叩き込まれたあの日以来、これほど走ったことはないと嘆く。ジュリアンは「焔の杖で甘やかし坊やをしつけなきゃダメさ」と皮肉を飛ばし、ナシュは周囲を見回しながら、「あの二人とギギはどこに行っちゃったんでしょう？」と首をかしげる。そんな中、ヒルディブランドはひとり前へ進み出て、「よこしまなる悪党どもよ、観念して姿を現すがよい！」と大声で呼びかけた。すると、どこからともなく二人の老人が飛び出し、これでもかというほど仰々しい名乗りを上げる。一人は「千の竜を屠り、銀の槍で天を穿つ者、オーランド！」と叫び、もう一人は「古今無双の魔法を操り、老いと失禁以外のあらゆる病を打ち払う神の手、ゴンスパール！」と続け、二人揃って「グランド・サー、エクセルシオール！」と声を合わせる。その様子に、シルは笑うべきか泣くべきか分からなくなり、まとめてやりたい衝動に駆られる。ヒルディブランドは一瞬「グランドサイア」と言いかけて咳払いしつつも、あらためて蒼天騎士団の名を騙り、令嬢たちを虚偽の名目で私的な宴に誘い込んだ罪を並び立て、金銭的にも精神的にも多大な損害を与えたとして告発する。紳士探偵たる自分は、被害者であるイシュガルドの娘たちの名代としてここに来たのだと高らかに宣言し、「武器を捨て、自主的にお縄につくがいい」と迫る。しかしオーランドは逆に「不遜な小僧め、自分の言動を恥じるがいい！」と怒鳴り返し、この日を必ず後悔させてやると息巻いて突撃する。ところが、久々の戦いに血が騒ぎすぎたのか、勢い余って盛大に転落し、自らを「ほとんど死んだ」状態に追い込んでしまう。シルはつい先日も似たような光景を見たばかりだと顔をしかめ、急ぎ手を打てばまだ助かるはずだと判断し、「古今無双の魔法使い」に視線を向ける。ようやく自分のことだと気づいたゴンスパールは、うーんと唸りながら、なぜか「奈落の底よりしもべを呼び出し、敵を滅ぼさん」だの、「肉を裂く風の渦を生み出し、我が“敵”を討つ」だのと物騒な詠唱を始めてしまい、シルは「敵じゃなくて仲間だろう！」と悲鳴を上げる。場が混沌としかけたそのとき、ギギを人質に取ったドリスが陰から姿を現し、「やめないと、このマメットがどうなっても知らないよ」と制止の声を上げた。ヒルディブランドは愕然とし、シルは、イシュガルドでもイディルシャイアでも見かけた顔だと確信する。ドリスは自らを「美と恐怖の仮面をまとい、王侯貴族を欺いてきた“真夜中の影”」とこれまた芝居がかった口調で名乗り、こちらの見抜く目を鼻で笑う。自分たちの変装を見破るなど不可能と思っていたのか、と皮肉を述べながらも、結局はこうしてまんまと罠にかかってくれたと嘲る。これまでの宴や小さな企みは、すべてこの瞬間のための布石にすぎない。最初から彼らの狙いは、このマメットただ一体だったのだと明かすのだった。</p>
<p>やがて煙幕が晴れる頃には、グランド・サーとドリスは、恐ろしく遅い足取りながらも確かに撤退し、ギギを連れ去ってしまっていた。シルは咳き込みながら視界の悪さに悪態をつき、「あんな芝居がかった退却のくせに、歩みはアダマンタス並みにのろい」と皮肉を漏らす。一方ヒルディブランドは、罪悪感と不安に押し潰されそうになっていた。グランド・サーを捕らえようと躍起になるあまり、彼らの真の狙いに気づいたときにはすでに遅く、愛する息子を奪われてしまった。もし二度とギギに会えなかったら……そう考えた途端、胸が締めつけられる。ナシュはナシュなりに、「もしかしたらもう Radz–at–Han の半分くらいまで行ってるかもしれませんね」と突飛なことを言い出すが、シルは大きくため息をつき、あの足取りではそこまで進めるはずがないと冷静に否定する。ジュリアンはそんなやりとりを一喝し、「さっさと追いかけるよ、あのくたばりぞこないどもを」と鋭く言い放つ。その口から「ミルクソップ（甘やかされ坊や）」という言葉が飛び出した瞬間、シルの脳裏には、かつての師匠が浴びせた数々の罵倒が蘇る。妙に懐かしくなるのを振り払い、彼は「とはいえ軽挙妄動は禁物だ」と気を引き締め直す。追跡していると悟られれば、連中はまた逃げ出すだろう──たとえアダマンタスのような歩調でも、逃げられてしまえば意味がない。ナシュは遠くを見つめ、「あの二人、寝てるんでしょうか、それとも目を閉じて休んでるだけ？」と呑気に考え、ジュリアンは、どうして自分が犯人たちをぶん殴って話を終わらせないのか不思議そうなあなたの視線に気づいて、「バカ息子の頭をカチ割るべきときと、あえて放っておいて自分の尻を拭かせるべきときがあるのさ」とぼそりと教える。そのころ、少し離れた茂みの中では、オーランド、ドリス、ゴンスパールが身を潜めながら、「ほら見ろ、死は常にすぐそばにいるんだ！」だの、「あれは死神じゃなくて通りすがりだよ、この間抜け！」だのと小競り合いを続け、年齢と疲労、計画の重圧に神経をすり減らしていた。</p>
<p>やがて一行は、聖モシャーヌ植物園近くの廃墟に近づいたところでようやく腰を落ち着ける。そこでグランド・サーたちは焚き火を囲み、息を整えることにしたようだ。隠れ場所から様子をうかがうヒルディブランドは、「どうやら、グランド・サーを追っていたはずの名探偵が、自分で仕掛けた網に捕らえたようだね」と皮肉を込めて状況を評する。シルも皮肉には同意するものの、「今のままでは“捕まえた”とは言えない」と冷静に指摘する。彼らの手中には、今もギギがいるのだ。まだ勝利には程遠い。苛立ちを抑えきれないシルは、何か打開策……ほんの小さな好機でもいいから、状況をひっくり返す手段が欲しいと口にする。その一言がきっかけとなり、「あの老竜騎士を奇襲して人質に取り、ギギとの交換条件に使う」という発想が浮かぶ。だがヒルディブランドは目を丸くし、紳士として高齢者を暴力的に拉致し身代金代わりにすることなど、とても容認できないと断言する。彼によれば、この問題を解くには、名誉と徳を重んじる紳士らしい方法を選ばねばならないらしい。とはいえ、その代案として提示されたのは、「老竜騎士にそっと近づいて気絶させ、その鎧を拝借して変装に使う」という作戦であり、シルは思わずこめかみを押さえる。老人をすっぽんぽんにするのが、人質に取るより「紳士的」とは到底思えないと抗議するが、ヒルディブランドは自信たっぷりに「真のマンデヴィル的変装術を見せてやろう」と胸を張るのだった。</p>
<p>半ば呆れながらも、あなたはヒルディブランドの立てた作戦に従い、一人でオーランドのいる地点へ向かう。驚いたように振り返った老竜騎士は、あなたをしげしげと眺め、「どこかで会ったような……その頼もしそうな前腕、その強くて優しげな指先……」と妙な感想を漏らす。そして、長年溜まり続けた肩こりがどうにも取れないのだとこぼし、「若者よ、ついでに肩を揉んでくれないか」と頼んでくる。鎧越しではうまくいかないと説明すると、彼はあっさり納得し、「胸甲を外すのを手伝ってくれ」とストラップの留め具を任せてくる。あなたが手際よく作業を進めると、オーランドは「いやはや、若いのに聖人のようだ」とご機嫌になり、「歳を取ると、こういうささやかなことが何よりありがたくなる」としみじみ語る。かつては亡き妻が、こうして甲冑を脱がせてくれたのだ、と懐かしそうに笑いながら、彼は座り直し、より「ていねいな施術」を受ける体勢に入る。さらに、もし手元にサラマンダーの軟膏があれば、胸や鼻の下に塗ってもらい、夜通しぐっすり眠れるのにと語り、こよなく愛した「ピグズニー」の手つきを思い出してうっとりと目を閉じる。やがて呼吸はゆっくりとなり、静かな寝息へと変わる。ふとその音が途絶え、あなたは思わず身を乗り出す。もしかして、今しがた彼の最期を見届けてしまったのではないか──そう恐れながらおそるおそる指先を伸ばした瞬間、オーランドの身体がぴくりと痙攣し、苦しげな呼吸が再開される。安堵したあなたは、今こそ好機とばかりに、そっとサバトンと脚鎧を脱がせる。こうして老騎士は半裸のまま、熊やモルボルがうろつく野ざらしの地に取り残されることとなり、「どうか安らかに」というシステムメッセージめいた皮肉を背に受けながら、あなたは鎧を携えて撤退するのだった。</p>
<p>アンサリング・クォーターへ戻ると、ヒルディブランドはあなたを「頼れる助手」と称え、竜騎士をしかるべき敬意をもって「処理」しつつ、必要な装備を手に入れてきてくれたのだと理解する。「素晴らしい成果だ、では早速この鎧を拝借し、オーランドに成り代わってギギを救い出してみせよう！」と胸を張る彼に、シルは呆れ顔で「二人は似ても似つかない」と指摘する。老いさらばえて遅くなっているとはいえ、連中は決して盲目ではないのだ。しかしヒルディブランドは、マンデヴィル流の変装術を甘く見てはならないとばかりに微笑み、「最前列でこの妙技を堪能させてあげよう」と言って聞かない。やがて、グランド・サーたちの野営地では、ゴンスパールが「そろそろ夕飯か？」と腹をさすっているところだった。「さっき食べたばかりだよ、このボケ老人」とドリスは憤慨し、オーランドがいつまでたっても戻らないことに苛立ちを募らせる。彼が一時間おきに用を足しに行くのは分かるが、それにしたって遅すぎる、と。そこへ、オーランドの鎧を身にまとったヒルディブランドが、「古き良き時代の同志諸君、我は戻った！」と堂々と歩み出る。遠目から見ていたシルは「終わった……」と絶望の言葉を漏らすが、ドリスは意外にもあっさり変装を受け入れ、「全く、時間がかかったじゃないか」と文句を言うにとどまる。そしてすぐさま、「あと十分で出発の準備をしな」と仲間に指示を飛ばす。そこでヒルディブランドは、「その前に、まずはギギを解放しなければならない」と言い出す。子どもを檻に閉じ込めるなど、紳士のすることではないと力説し、「彼はほら、この通り私の庇護のもとにいる。だから、まったく別の話として、今からちょっとだけ、一緒に荒野を散歩してくるよ」ともっともらしく付け加える。ドリスは「逃げられるに決まってるだろうが！」と怒鳴るが、ヒルディブランドは飄々と受け流し、ギギを連れて歩き出そうとする。少し離れた場所からそれを見ていたシルは、思わず「馬鹿な……本当にうまくいってる……？」と呟く。彼らは今にもギギを抱えたヒルディブランドを見逃そうとしているのだ。</p>
<p>だが、そのささやかな勝利の瞬間は長くは続かなかった。森のほうから、震えながらよろめき出てきたオーランドが、「さ、寒い……モルボルが追いかけてくる……」とぼやき始めたのだ。鎧姿の自分そっくりの人物を目にして、彼は自分が自分なのに、向こうも自分というあり得ない状況に混乱し、「これは人生が走馬灯のように流れ始める瞬間だ……最愛のピグズニーよ、ついにまた一緒になれる」と覚悟を決めてしまう。一方ドリスは、目の前の二人を見比べ、「この茶番じみた手口で私を騙せると思ったのかい、このペテン師！」と激昂する。「死ぬってこんなに痛いものだったか！？」と騒ぐオーランドを尻目に、ヒルディブランドはギギの腕を取り、「今だ、逃げるぞ！」と促す。しかしドリスは、それを遮るように一言、「ヴィヴィ、待って！」と叫んだ。その名を聞いた瞬間、ギギの身体はびくりと震える。どこかで聞いたことのある名前……頭の奥で何かが軋むような感覚に囚われながら、彼は「ヴィヴィ……ヴィヴィ……」と繰り返す。ドリスはたたみかけるように、「自分が誰で、何者なのか思い出しな、ヴィヴィ。あんたは、偉大なるシャーレアンの大魔導士、クァンの創り出した存在なんだよ」と告げる。</p>
<p>ギギ──いや、ヴィヴィは、その名をもう一度口にする。「クァン……クァン……」。すると、今まで霞がかっていた記憶が一気に鮮明になる。命を与えられ、グランパパ・クァンと共に暮らし、彼に外の世界のことを様々教わった日々。温かな時間が蘇り、声にはかつての幸福がにじむ。しかし、思い出はそこで終わらない。やがて彼は、「それから、グランパパ・クァンはぼくを見捨てたんだ……」と震える声で続ける。ドリスが代わりに説明する。クァンは、ヴィヴィが「時間を巻き戻す力」に欠けていると判断し、自分を若返らせることはできないと見限ったのだと。そうして「欠陥品」だと決めつけ、ヴィヴィを見捨て、やがて孤独な最期を迎えたのだ、と。シルはその説明の中から「時を巻き戻す」という言葉を拾い上げ、クロジエで目にした光景と結びつける。あのときギギが壊れた高価な花瓶に向けて見せた力──あれが人間に向けられたらどうなるのか。動揺しながら、「しかし、君たちはどうやってそこまで知ったんだ？　クァンの仲間だったとは思えない」と問い返す。ドリスはすでに用意していた答えを口にする。彼らは、数々の遺物を求めて「大図書館」を漁っていた際、クァンの残した日誌を見つけたのだと。かつては戦時下で名を馳せた英雄であり、莫大な財を築いた彼らも、時の流れには勝てなかった。気づけば刀を鞘に納めねばならぬ時が訪れ、イシュガルドは彼らの力を必要としなくなっていた。そこで彼らはイディルシャイアに流れ着き、身体が動く限りは得意の戦いと探索で食いつなごうとしていたという。そんな折、大図書館の埃まみれの書架の中から見つけたのが、「壊れたものを元の状態に戻すマメット」の記録だった。時間魔法で時を巻き戻し、失われた青春を取り戻せるかもしれない──彼らにとって、まさに「第二の人生」と呼ぶにふさわしい希望だった。日誌を読み解き、マメットがクォルタス西部高地のどこかに眠っていると突き止めたとき、彼らの心は大きく沸き立った。あと一歩で手が届くところまで来ていたのに、あなたたちが雪の中からヴィヴィを掘り出すのを目撃し、危うくすべてが台無しになりかけたのだとドリスは吐き捨てる。今、彼女はもう一度ヴィヴィに呼びかける。「一緒に来な、そうすれば、あんた本来の力を引き出す手伝いができる。若さを取り戻すだけじゃない。あんたなら、クァン様さえ蘇らせられるかもしれないんだよ」。ヴィヴィは、驚きと恐怖と期待の入り混じった奇妙な声をあげ、金属のような悲鳴を伴って揺れ動く。シルは顔をしかめ、「死者を“本当に”戻せる魔法など存在しない」と断言する。できるのはせいぜい死体を操ることまでであり、死霊術の産物がフューリーの御前で忌まわしい存在であることは、教義をひもとくまでもない、と。ヒルディブランドは必死に言葉を探し、ギギとの冒険や、手に入れたばかりの涼亭のこと、マンデヴィル家のマメットとしての誇りを思い出させようとする。「きみはマンデヴィルのマメットだ」と。しかしギギ──ヴィヴィの答えは、優しくも揺るぎない。「パパ・ヒルディは、いつもぼくに優しくしてくれた。そのことにはずっと感謝してる。でも……ぼくを創ったのはグランパパ・クァンなんだ。ぼくは彼に創られて、彼のもとで暮らして……そして、今も会いたい。だから、たとえ失敗しても、ぼくは試さなきゃいけないんだ」と言い、彼はヒルディブランドに背を向け、ドリスたちの後を追うのだった。</p>
<p>シルは「待て、止めないと！」と叫ぶが、ヒルディブランドは一瞬ためらい、「彼の決意を尊重すべきなのかもしれない」と小さく呟く。しかしすぐに顔をしかめる。自分自身、かつて「旅をする探偵になる」と決め、その選択に頑ななまでにこだわり続けてきた。その一本気な性格こそが、ギギの頑固さの源でもあるのだろう。だが、だからといって息子が時間魔法で自然の摂理をねじ曲げるのを、黙って見ていることはできない。ヒルディブランドは拳を握り、「父親である自分が、息子に正しい道を歩ませねばならない」と言い切る。もし死者を蘇らせるというのなら、せめて正統派の「古き良きゾンビ化」の手段に限るべきだ、と、いつもの調子で言葉を継ぐ。彼は姿勢を正し、シルへ向き直ると、ここまでの尽力に感謝を述べたうえで、今のまま追跡を続ければギギを追い詰め、取り返しのつかない行動に走らせてしまう危険があると訴える。だからこそ、グランド・サーたちに対する追及を一時中断してほしい──父親として、息子を穏やかに説得する時間が欲しいのだと頼み込む。シルは逡巡ののち、ギギの力の全容が分からない以上、息子がその力を振るうと決めたときに強硬策に出るのは危険だと認める。「分かった、しばらくは追跡を停止しよう」と彼は頷く。ヒルディブランドは満面の笑みを浮かべ、「やはり君なら理解してくれると思っていた！」と喜び、「さあ、時間が惜しい。ナシュ、ジュリアン、我らが新しい東屋に戻って作戦会議だ！」と勢いよく声を上げる。ジュリアンは半ば呆れ、半ば感心しながら、「あっさり諦められても拍子抜けだったからね」とぼそりとこぼしつつ、これでしばらくは自分もイディルシャイアに留まらねばならないと苦笑する。一方で、もしあのマメットが本当に若さを取り戻す力を持っているのだとしたら……という邪な期待が、彼女の瞳に怪しい光を宿らせるのだった。</p>
<p>シルは約束どおりグランド・サーへの直接的な追跡を中断するが、事件そのものを放棄するわけではなかった。彼はあなたと共にイシュガルドへ戻り、ファウンデーションのエーテライト広場で再会すると、異端審問所には「異端の書物」の蔵書が山ほどあり、その中にはシャーレアン由来の文献も少なくないのだと説明する。彼はそれらを洗いざらい調べ、時間魔法に関する情報を探し出すつもりでいる──もちろん、すべてはあのマメットの出自がどれほど異端的かを確認するためだけであり、それ以上の意味はない、と強調する。だがあなたの視線は、「本当にそれだけか」と言わんばかりに鋭い。シルは途端に落ち着きを失い、「な、何だ、その目は？　私の興味が“職務以上”のものであるとでも？　とんでもない、そんなことはないとも」と慌てて弁解する。そしてぶっきらぼうに「とにかく、協力に感謝する。今回はここまでだ」と締めくくり、ギギの力と運命という新たな謎を、そのままフューリーへの祈りのように宙へ放り出すのだった。</p>

    story:`<div class="clamp" data-collapsed="true">
<p>在 Idyllshire 的新「涼亭」前，Gigi 把剛畫好的 family crest 高高舉起，像是在展現一件得意之作。Cyr 望著那畫，卻沒有半點欣賞的心情，只覺得心中的不安越來越重──那個老女人肯定是從 Ishgard 一路跟著他們來的，這點毋庸置疑。她絕對牽涉其中，只是究竟「什麼角色」還是個謎。Nashu 對這股緊張完全無感，只顧著拍手稱讚，說 Gigi 果然跟他的 grandpapa 一樣有天份。Julyan 則雙臂抱胸，掃視這座由冒險者與 gobbie 拼湊出的聚落，悶聲抱怨就算她願意對兒子的胡鬧睜一眼閉一眼，這裡也絕對不是適合養孩子的地方。Gigi 心裡想的只有自己的作品，他笑著問大家喜不喜歡這個家徽，講著講著差點脫口而出「還應該畫上 Grandpapa Godbert 跟 Gra──」，又慌忙改口叫 Julyan「m’lady」。稍晚一些，Hildibrand 打了個大大的哈欠，坦承就算身為紳士，他的 stamina 也是有限的，這時候來一杯紅茶好像不錯。Nashu 拉了拉他的袖子，指向遠處──那兩個老人已經盯著他們看了好幾分鐘。Hildibrand 卻把這當成粉絲常見的反應，說許多人真正面對偶像時，反而會被緊張與崇拜嚇得逃掉。Cyr 一點也笑不出來，他咬牙回嘴說，也許、就只是也許，那兩個就是該死的 Grand Sers。當那兩道身影轉身離開時，他立刻大喊追上去。一行人匆忙展開追擊，Gigi 則在後方揮手喊道，那兩個人是往右邊跑的，要大家先走，他很快就會追上來。</p>
<p>一路追到 Dravanian Hinterlands 的 The Answering Quarter，Cyr 已經累得上氣不接下氣，一邊喘一邊咒罵 Fury，說自己已經很久沒有跑得這麼拼命了，上一次還是被 Ser Charibert 拿著燃燒的武器，在 Steps of Faith 上上下下追著跑。Julyan 冷冷回他一句：「不打不成器嘛，小孬種就是這樣養出來的。」Nashu 則四處張望，疑惑那兩個老人和 Gigi 到底跑到哪裡去了。Hildibrand 依然沒有洩氣，他昂首走向空地，對著前方大喊，要那些「卑鄙的壞蛋」現身。隨著聲音落下，兩名老者從暗處一躍而出，用誇張到近乎滑稽的語氣報上名號：一位自稱斬殺過千千萬萬條龍，是刺穿蒼穹的銀色長槍 Orland；另一位則自封為古今無雙的大魔法師 Gonspart，聲稱自己的「神聖之手」治癒了所有疾病，除了老化與失禁。兩人最後還一起喊出「Grand Sers，excelsior！」讓 Cyr 一時之間不知道該笑還是該哭。Hildibrand 一度差點把他們叫成「grandsires」，趕緊咳了一聲，隨即恢復嚴肅，宣告他們冒充 Heavens’ Ward 的騎士，欺騙 Ishgard 貴族千金，以虛假名義邀請對方參加私下聚會，造成嚴重的金錢與精神損失。作為 agent of enquiry、inspector extraordinaire，他是代表那些無辜、手無寸鐵的少女們前來，為她們討回公道。如今，他命令兩人放下武器，向自己投降。Orland 卻反過來痛斥他膽大妄為，警告他一定會為此後悔。說完，他突然陷入興奮，像是久違地嗅到戰場氣味，猛然衝出去，結果卻衝過頭，一個華麗的摔落把自己摔得「幾乎要死」。Cyr 想起最近才見過的類似場景，只能扶額，判斷如果動作夠快，這個人還是有機會被救回來，便把眼光轉向那位「古今無雙的大魔法師」。Gonspart 花了一段時間才搞清楚大家是在叫他，然後開始唸起又長又玄的咒文，一會兒要從深淵召喚魔物，一會兒又想製造撕裂血肉的烈風渦流來「smite my foes」，把夥伴也一併當成敵人，逼得 Cyr 大喊：「你們不是朋友嗎！」就在場面即將失控時，Dorys 抱著 Gigi 從陰影中走出來，以「你們再繼續亂來，這個 mammet 就別想活」為威脅，叫所有人住手。Hildibrand 大叫 Gigi 的名字，Cyr 則終於肯定，這個女人正是一路從 Ishgard 到 Idyllshire 都在尾隨他們的可疑人物。Dorys 也不甘示弱，自稱是「戴著美麗與恐怖雙重面具，欺騙無數王侯貴族的午夜之影」，用同樣戲劇化的口氣回敬他們。她嘲諷你們或許以為自己絕不會被拙劣的偽裝騙過，但最後還是如此輕易地踏入了陷阱──那些宴會，那些小騙局，其實從一開始就只是鋪陳。他們的真正目標，始終只有這一個 mammet。</p>
<p>等到煙霧與騷動稍稍平息，Grand Sers 和 Dorys 早已帶著 Gigi 離開，雖然步伐緩慢到像是 adamantoise 一樣，卻確實把人帶走了。Cyr 咳了幾聲，抱怨自己根本看不清，加上對方又故意裝得驚天動地，其實前進的速度慢得可笑。Hildibrand 則完全笑不出來，他被愧疚與恐懼壓得幾乎喘不過氣來。他承認自己急著將 Grand Sers 一網打盡，以至於直到最後一刻才意識到對方真正的目標是 Gigi，結果眼睜睜看著兒子被奪走。他忍不住想：如果從此再也見不到 Gigi 怎麼辦？Nashu 一如既往地腦補，說不定對方現在已經快要到 Radz–at–Han 了。Cyr 只能無奈嘆氣，那種步調根本不可能跑得那麼遠。Julyan 則一句話打斷所有胡思亂想，叫大家趕緊去追那些「老不死」。她口中的 milksop 再度勾起 Cyr 的回憶，那正是他的 mentor 當年常叫他的外號之一。回神之後，他也再度提醒眾人不能躁進，若是讓對方察覺自己被跟蹤，很可能又會再度逃跑──就算只是以 adamantoise 的速度，那也是逃掉。Nashu 仰望遠方，還在好奇那些人現在到底是在睡覺，還是單純閉目養神。Julyan 注意到你疑惑的視線，又像是看穿你心裡的問題，說自己之所以沒有上去抡起平底鍋把事情結束，是因為有時候該敲碎兒子腦袋，有時候則該讓那個蠢兒子自己面對麻煩。此時不遠處的灌木叢裡，Orland、Dorys、Gonspart 一邊躲躲藏藏，一邊吵個不停。Orland 覺得死神彷彿在每個轉角盯著他，Dorys 則嫌他大驚小怪，說那只是路過的人，Gonspart 則含含糊糊地碎念，顯然年歲、疲勞與這場計畫的壓力，都已讓他們的神經繃得發緊。</p>
<p>最後，一行人總算在 Saint Mocianne’s Arboretum 附近的廢墟附近停下腳步。Grand Sers 似乎決定在那裡稍作休息，生火紮營。躲在暗處觀察的 Hildibrand 看著這一幕，帶著幾分自嘲說，搞到最後，Grand Sers 又一次被原本追捕他們的 inspector 給逮住。Cyr 對這種「自作自受式的諷刺」並不否認，但他也提醒，此刻說什麼勝利還為時過早，因為對方手上的 Gigi 還是最重要的籌碼。這讓他越想越煩躁，忍不住出聲希望能出現一個轉機，哪怕只是微小的機會，也足以扭轉局勢。於是，一個念頭冒上心頭：如果能趁 Orland 落單時先下手，把他抓來當人質，再提出交換 Gigi 的要求呢？Hildibrand 聽到這樣的建議，整個人像被雷打到一樣直瞪眼，斬釘截鐵地否決這種作法。身為紳士，怎麼能接受用暴力綁架一位長者，再拿對方做談判籌碼？這種事他絕對不能認同。他堅持，這個問題必須用「名譽與品格」兼顧的方式來解決。於是，他提出了自己的替代方案──也是讓 Cyr 更想扶額的提案：你去悄悄接近那位老 dragoon，找機會把他制服，然後把他的 armor 拿過來，讓自己可以假扮成 Orland 混進敵營。Cyr 忍不住吐槽，把老人家脫到只剩內衣，比起人質戰術到底哪裡更「紳士」？但 Hildibrand 只是笑著叫他別急，說等會兒就能親眼見識何謂 Manderville 式的完美偽裝。</p>
<p>儘管心裡千百個問號，你仍照著這個計畫行動，一個人接近獨自值守的 Orland。被你嚇了一跳的老 dragoon 眯起眼打量你，說你的雙臂和指尖看起來異常可靠而溫柔，總覺得有種熟悉的感覺。他隨即開口拜託你幫忙按摩肩膀，抱怨身上的酸痛連 Gonspart 的魔法都解決不了。你說明若不把 breastplate 卸下就沒辦法好好放鬆，他居然毫不猶豫地同意，還請你幫忙把背後的 strap 解開。你一邊幫他脫甲，一邊開始按壓僵硬的肌肉，Orland 一邊舒了一口氣，一邊說你簡直是聖人，還感嘆人上了年紀後，越來越能體會這種小事的珍貴。他提起自己已故的妻子，以前都是她幫忙把 armor 卸下，然後再溫柔地替他放鬆疲憊的肩背。他慢慢調整坐姿，擺出更適合接受「細膩照顧」的姿勢，又感嘆如果身邊有一瓶 salamander 的藥膏就好了，他最喜歡讓心愛的 pigsney 把那種膏藥塗在胸口與鼻下，如此一來就能整晚安穩入眠。隨著你的手法，Orland 的語氣越來越鬆散，最後眼睛闔上，呼吸漸漸成了規律的鼻息。某一刻，那呼吸突然完全停住，你嚇得整個人向前探去，懷疑自己是不是親眼見證了一名老人最後的瞬間。你猶豫著伸出指尖準備試探他是否還活著，下一秒，他的身體突然抽動了一下，沙啞而吃力的呼吸再度響起。你暗自鬆了一口氣，趁著這個機會，用極小心的動作解下他的 sabatons 與 breeches，把整套 armor 完整取走。於是，一名半裸的老 dragoon 被留在滿地熊痕與 morbol 足跡的荒野之中，而你則帶著裝備悄悄撤退，耳邊彷彿還迴盪著系統那句帶著黑色幽默的祝福：「願他安息」。</p>
<p>回到 The Answering Quarter，Hildibrand 用一貫誇張的語氣迎接你這位「堅定的助手」，確認你確實在對一名上了年紀的 dragoon 給予充分敬意（至少在他看來是這樣），又成功帶回所需的裝備。於是他宣布，自己將立刻化身 Orland，潛入敵人當中，把 Gigi 救出來。Cyr 看著眼前這個穿上老 dragoon 鎧甲、但無論身形還是臉孔都相差十萬八千里的 inspector，只能再度強調，他們或許老、或許慢，可並沒有瞎。Hildibrand 卻滿懷自信，說等著看吧，這可是 Manderville 流偽裝術的壓軸演出。另一邊的營地裡，Gonspart 正懷疑是不是吃飯時間又到了，摸著肚子問晚餐好了沒。Dorys 火冒三丈地回他，明明才剛吃完不久，還順帶抱怨 Orland 一去就是那麼久。就算老年人確實需要頻繁「解放膀胱」，也不該這麼誇張。就在這時，穿著 Orland 鎧甲的 Hildibrand 大搖大擺走進營地，向「年邁的同伴們」問好，宣稱自己回來了。遠處偷看的 Cyr 一出口就是一句「完蛋了」，但 Dorys 卻像沒起疑似的，只是嫌他拖拖拉拉，並指示大家十分鐘內收拾完行李，準備啟程。Hildibrand 抓準時機，表示在出發前必須先放 Gigi 出來，因為把孩子關在 cage 裡實在有失 gentleman 的風範。Dorys 氣得大吼，說他到底在胡扯什麼，那孩子一放出來就會逃跑。然而 Hildibrand 指著 cage 說，看吧，他還在自己照看之下，根本沒逃。接著又用一種「完全無關」的語氣補上一句，他打算帶孩子去 wilderness 走一小段路，當作短暫的散步。Cyr 在旁邊看得驚心動魄，忍不住低聲驚呼，這居然真的奏效了──Hildibrand 就要這樣把 Gigi 帶出來，而對方竟然沒有要阻止。</p>
<p>然而，這場小小的勝利瞬間很快就被打破。Orland 披頭散髮、渾身發抖地從林子那頭走出來，一邊喊冷、一邊抱怨有 morbol 在追他。看到自己面前站著一個「穿著完整 armor 的自己」，他整個人陷入混亂，開始自言自語說，他明明是自己，但對方也是自己，除非……除非這就是所謂的人生跑馬燈，此刻他正要死去，即將與心愛的 pigsney 再次相聚。Dorys 卻沒有時間陪他發牢騷，她看著兩個 Orland，瞬間意識到真相，大吼一句「Impostor！」，怒斥居然有人敢用這種連 minstrel 都講不出口的老梗來騙她。Orland 邊喊著原來死掉這麼痛，一邊在一旁演戲，Hildibrand 則抓緊時間拉著 Gigi 想跑。就在這個節骨眼，Dorys 再度出聲：「Vivi，等等！」那個名字像是某種開關，讓 Gigi 的身體整個一震。他喃喃重複著 Vivi 這個音節，努力回想自己在哪裡聽過它。Dorys 趁勝追擊，叫他記起自己是誰、是什麼──記起你是 Vivi，是由偉大的 Sharlayan archmagus Quan 所創造的存在。</p>
<p>Gigi──或者說 Vivi──再次低聲唸出「Quan」的名字，一遍又一遍。漸漸地，被封存的記憶像是被時間解凍般湧了回來。他記起自己的誕生，記起與 Grandpapa Quan 一起生活的日子，想起那位 archmagus 怎樣照顧他、教他認識 outside world。那一段時間是那麼溫暖，以至於他的聲音一度變得柔和。然而畫面並沒有在幸福之處停下來，他緊接著說出更痛苦的部分──有一天，Grandpapa Quan 認定他是 flawed，認為他缺乏能把時間往回推、讓自己恢復青春的力量，於是把他拋棄，然後孤獨地死去。Cyr 抓住其中一句話：「turn back the hands of time？」他立刻聯想到當初在 The Jeweled Crozier 目睹的場景，那時候 Gigi 只用一次奇怪的力量，就讓一只珍貴的花瓶從粉碎狀態回復原樣。既然可以對物品這樣做，若是施加在人身上呢？他又不禁質疑，這三個老人怎麼可能知道那麼多？他們又不是 archmagus Quan 的同伴。Dorys 先一步給出答案，她說他們是在一次又一次前往 Great Library 尋寶時，在滿是灰塵的書架之間找到 Quan 的 journals。她回憶，自己與同伴們年輕時是戰爭中的英雄，是 Ishgard 的名將，手裡握有能與其名聲匹敵的財富。但沒有任何 warrior 能打敗 time。某天回過神，他們發現自己已經站在「收刀入鞘」的時間點，Ishgard 也再不需要他們的服務。於是，他們來到 Idyllshire，靠著搜集 relics、轉賣寶物勉強維生，只為能以自己熟悉的方式活到身體再也撐不住為止。在那樣的日子裡，他們在 Great Library 的深處發現了一線希望──關於一個 mammet 的紀錄。那個 mammet 擁有「把破碎之物恢復到最完美狀態」的能力，能藉由 temporal magicks 把時間往回拉，讓人有機會拿回所謂的「misspent youth」。憑藉著 journals，他們慢慢推斷出那個 mammet 就在 Coerthas western highlands 的某處。他們的「第二人生」似乎近在眼前，結果卻被迫目睹你把 Vivi 從雪堆裡挖出來，當場把所有計畫打亂。現在，她再一次向 Vivi 伸出手。若他跟她們走，她們會幫他 unlock 自己真正的潛能。只要掌握這份力量，他不只能讓她們再度年輕，甚至或許有能力把 archmagus Quan 的生命也「restore」回來。Vivi 發出帶有雜音的喊聲，看起來既被吸引又害怕。Cyr 則幾乎是本能地後退，說任何 magick 都不可能真正讓死者「回來」。頂多只是 animate 一具 corpse，而 necromancy 的產物，在 Fury 的戒律裡毫無疑問是 abomination。Hildibrand 也顧不得維持形象，急忙叫 Gigi 想起你們一起經歷的冒險、共同擁有的 gazebo，還有他身為 Manderville mammet 的身分。Gigi 的回答卻是柔軟而堅定的：Papa Hildy 一直對他很好，這份 kindness 他永遠都會記得。但創造他的人是 Grandpapa Quan，他在那個人身邊生活、學習，如今也同樣深深思念對方。就算結果是失敗，他也必須親自試一次。說完，他轉身跟著 Dorys 和 Grand Sers 離開。</p>
<p>Cyr 急得大喊必須阻止他們，可 Hildibrand 卻猶豫了。他短暫地說，也許他們應該尊重 Gigi 的選擇，但這種念頭很快就被打消。他想起自己曾經做出的決定──要成為一名 traveling inspector，並且至今從未動搖過。那種一根筋的固執，很可能也影響了 Gigi。即便如此，眼睜睜看著兒子用 temporal magicks 去扭動自然規律，卻什麼也不做，對他來說根本不可能。他握緊拳頭，說自己身為父親，有責任讓 Gigi 保持在正確的路上。就算哪天真要讓死人起身，也必須使用「正統方式」的 zombification，而不是這種扭曲時序的手段。接著，他轉向 Cyr，先感謝對方一路以來對案件的堅持，也坦白表示，如果持續用現在的方式追捕 Grand Sers，很可能會把 Gigi 逼到絕境，讓他在絕望之下亂用自己的力量。因此，他正式提出請求，希望 Cyr 能暫時 suspend 對 Grand Sers 的追緝，給他這個當父親的機會，讓他能在不動武的前提下，勸 Gigi 平靜地回頭。Cyr 在猶豫之後，承認他們完全不了解 Gigi 能做到哪種程度，如果在那樣的未知下過度刺激對方，一旦他決定使用 magicks，所有人都可能陷入危險。於是他點頭答應，在這段期間不再以「追捕犯人」的方式行動。Hildibrand 露出如釋重負的笑容，說早就知道 Cyr 會理解自己。接著他說現在已經沒有多餘時間可以浪費，馬上呼喚 Nashu 與 Julyan 回到他們的新 gazebo，開始討論下一步的計畫。Julyan 一邊咕噥著，說如果兒子這麼快就放棄，反而讓人失望；如今他還願意為了 Gigi 持續折騰，她只好也留在這裡更久。不過，若那個該死的 mammet 真有讓人重獲青春的能力……她心裡又冒出另一種興奮，眼神也跟著亮了起來。</p>
<p>Cyr 說過要暫停追捕，他就真的照做了，但這並不代表他要就此放棄。回到 Ishgard 之後，他在 Foundation 的 Ishgard Aetheryte Plaza 與你會合，說明 Inquisition 的書庫裡收藏了大量 heretical tomes，其中很多都來自 Sharlayan。他打算好好翻那些書，收集關於 temporal magicks 的一切資訊。當然，他強調，這純粹是為了查明這個 mammet 的出身到底有多麼異端，僅此而已。你看著他，有點像是在暗示「真的是這樣嗎」，他馬上慌了，說自己不懂為什麼你要用那種眼神看他，好像他的興趣已經超出 professional 範圍。說完，他用一種半逃避的口氣感謝你至今為止的協助，說這樣就夠了，讓你先告一段落。於是，你只得帶著各種未解的問題離開──關於 Gigi 的力量、他的抉擇，以及未來會如何在這片世界的時間與命運之中，掀起什麼樣的波紋。</p>
