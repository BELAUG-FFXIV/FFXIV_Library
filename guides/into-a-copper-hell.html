      <p>The petitioner arrives at the Quicksand just as Momodi said he would, bursting in from the blazing Ul’dahn sun and declaring that another moment outside would have set him afire, before calling for a tankard of ale. Momodi greets him as Papashan and remarks that his timing is excellent, for the adventurer who will handle his petition is already here. Recognizing you, Papashan brightens and declares how glad he is that his good friend Forename will be the one to help, before properly introducing himself as Papashan, formerly of the Sultansworn, and thanking you for agreeing to lend your aid. At Momodi’s prompting, he explains that the petition was submitted by an acquaintance at Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern, and concerns a grave development at Copperbell Mines: the place has been seized by giants. These are hecatoncheires, he says—fearsome giants who were sealed away in the depths of the mine in the days of the Thorne Dynasty. Somehow they have broken through the rock that was meant to imprison them and now prowl the tunnels where miners work, their anger at their treatment by your ancestors forcing all operations to cease. Momodi, thinking back, recalls that the Thorne Dynasty ended over three hundred years ago, and Papashan praises her knowledge as he elaborates: the people of that age used the hecatoncheires as slave labor, binding them with enchanted helms to work the mines. When the enchantments eventually failed, the slaves rose up, and in desperation your forebears collapsed the lowermost levels of Copperbell, ending the Great Giant Revolt by burying the giants under an unimaginable weight of rock. More recently, Momodi remembers reading an article in the Mythril Eye about Copperbell being reopened to meet rising demand for building materials, and surmises that the miners must have dug too deep and freed the giants. To think those creatures have survived three centuries underground, she says—they must be seething. Papashan agrees that their wrath makes them a danger to all, and declares that there can be no more mining at Copperbell while they endure; for the sake of both peace and prosperity, they must be subdued. The task he lays before you is perilous, and he does not deny it, but he begs you nonetheless to bring an end to this sorry business—and when you accept without hesitation, he is visibly relieved, insisting that it is for the best. Momodi warns you that Copperbell Mines lie in western Thanalan and urges you to take care, while Papashan adds that an employee of Amajina & Sons named Painted Mesa is presently in the Quicksand and knows the mines well, suggesting you seek his counsel before you go.</p>
      <p>Taking Papashan’s advice, you seek out Painted Mesa in the Quicksand, and the man wastes no time confirming his identity when you ask. On learning that you are the adventurer who has volunteered to deal with the situation in Copperbell, he remarks that you have guts, and hopes you have the skills to match, for things down there are far from pretty: the hecatoncheires have left the place in a terrible state in less than a week since mining resumed. He explains that Copperbell was already considered old when the second Ul Dynasty was still young, and that it was abandoned centuries ago; had it not been for the shortage of materials needed for Ul’dah’s rebuilding, the Concern would never have thought to reopen it. They knew about the giants from the start, he admits, but the project went ahead anyway—after all, who would imagine that anything could survive being buried under a mountain of rock for three hundred years? That assumption proved horribly wrong. With one swing of a pickaxe too many, the miners found themselves face-to-face with giants. Unless the hecatoncheires are subdued, he warns, the nation’s glorious recovery will grind to a halt for want of stone and ore. For now, the Stone Torches are keeping watch over the entrance, ready in case the giants decide they fancy sunlight and fresh air; one of them will show you the way in. In the end, Painted Mesa tells you that the hope of the nation rests on your shoulders and asks you to send the giants back to whichever of the seven hells they escaped from.</p>
      <p>You make your way across Thanalan to western Thanalan, where Copperbell Mines looms above Horizon’s Edge, and there you come upon the aftermath of another attempt to reclaim the tunnels. Alianne informs you that she and her comrades found Dolorous Bear and his entire party dead, the giants thorough in their work, and that the tracks suggest they tried to rush a horde of the creatures. She cannot say with certainty what drove such an experienced crew to abandon caution, but she has her suspicions: that men and women are often their own harshest critics, and in striving to surpass their previous achievements, they can lose sight of good sense and become reckless. Fixate upon a goal to the exclusion of all else, she warns, and you will pay the price, as Dolorous Bear and his fellows did that day. Nearby, Isildaure reflects that he has been an adventurer for many years and has borne witness to more than one pivotal moment in history; though the times have changed, he says, the essence of adventuring has not. It has ever been a quest for self-betterment through challenges freely faced, and always will be. With experience, an adventurer naturally acquires a love of justice and an understanding of self-sacrifice, and though such experience cannot be measured in any tangible fashion, it shapes who you are, grounded in the choices you make and their consequences, whether good or ill. When he looks at you, he says, he senses a light within you that tells him you are destined for greatness.</p>
      <p>At the entrance to the mine, a Stone Torch on duty informs you that there has been an incident inside Copperbell and that he and his comrades are here to ensure its effects are contained; for your own safety, he suggests that you stay well away. When you state your purpose and reveal that you are the adventurer who volunteered to quell the hecatoncheires, he is taken aback, confessing that he did not expect Papashan to find someone so quickly, if at all. For the moment, the giants seem content to wreak havoc within the tunnels, he says, but it is only a matter of time before they decide to step outside, and the sooner you deal with them, the better. He urges you to make ready as best you can and enter when you are prepared, assuring you that the Stone Torches will maintain their vigil in case any foe slips by you. With that, you call upon the Duty Finder and descend into Copperbell Mines, battling through the hecatoncheires who once shook the earth in revolt. When at last you emerge victorious, Copperbell pacified, you return to Ul’dah and the Quicksand. Painted Mesa greets you as the conqueror of Copperbell, overjoyed that, thanks to your efforts, mining operations can resume and Ul’dah will have the materials it needs to rebuild. The nation, he says, is in your debt. He promises to share the good tidings with Papashan the next time they meet and advises you to report to Momodi, remarking that it will do her good to see you alive and in one piece.</p>
      <p>Not long after, in the Steps of Nald outside the Quicksand, you hear a desperate cry and turn to see an Obnoxious Merchant berating a refugee woman, accusing the “thieving little swine” of stealing a choice cut of dodo from him. The woman—timid and trembling, a Desperate Damsel in truth—insists she stole nothing, that she bought the meat with her own coin, but the merchant dismisses her words as rot, sneering that refugees like her could not afford maggoty mole meat, let alone such fare. He threatens to turn her over to the Brass Blades to “keep the streets safe,” but then, claiming to be a reasonable man, offers her a vile alternative: if she will agree to serve him in whatever capacity he requires, he will see that the authorities never hear of her “crime.” In tears, she calls on the Twelve as witness to her innocence, and, seeing you, begs for your help, explaining that she only wished to treat her children to a decent meal with the coin she had painstakingly saved. When you step in, the merchant demands to know who you are—some cur’s master, perhaps—and, having had enough of what he calls a mummer’s farce, orders his bodyguards to teach you both a lesson. A duty begins, and one Filthy Bodyguard lurches forward, reeking of drink and boasting that he alone will handle you while the others watch. Though he belches threats and urges you to “bleed” for him, his bravado soon crumbles under your blows; between curses, he laments not having stopped at his seventh ale, and as the fight turns decisively against him, his comrades lose their stomach for the task and flee, grumbling that they are not being paid enough for this. The merchant shouts after them in fury, but they are gone, and the refugee woman thanks you over and over for your intervention.</p>
      <p>In that instant, the Echo takes hold, and the street melts away. You find yourself in Central Thanalan’s Spineless Basin, an unseen observer as a young city-dweller remarks that there seem to be more refugees than ever. His companion, a concerned citizen, confirms that he is not mistaken and explains that although some hamlets survived the Calamity’s immediate destruction, many were left with land that had turned barren or had been cut off from trade routes, problems not easily solved. People tried to make do, but in the end were forced to abandon their homes and seek a new life in the cities. Asked whether the same is happening elsewhere in the realm, the man says that if the talk is true, yes, though Ul’dah’s reputation for prosperity naturally draws more of the displaced here first. The younger man’s heart goes out to the refugees, but he admits to feeling apprehensive, hoping their presence does not foster lawlessness. His companion answers that if things do take a turn for the worse, they can count on the Immortal Flames, and that the Brass Blades would welcome their help—heroes who once fought the Garlean Empire now patrolling the streets for riffraff, if it comes to that. Not all refugees are bad, he adds; some find employment and live honest lives. Nearby, a sure-voiced salesman cries out that his dodo tenderloins are the cheapest in Thanalan, thanking a customer for her custom as though everything were normal. Looking around, the younger man observes that Ul’dah appears well on its way to recovery—but the older insists that if you peer beyond the veil of prosperity, you will find no end to misery and suffering. The Echo fades, and you return to yourself in Ul’dah as the refugee woman nervously asks whether you are all right. The merchant, already on the back foot, now demands to know if you mean to threaten a defenseless citizen, and tries to dismiss the claim that anyone saw her buy the meat as absurd—only for voices from the crowd to shout that they, too, witnessed the purchase, telling the “damnable vulture” to leave her alone. Startled, the merchant demands to know who dared speak, but finding no support, growls that he will overlook this once and stalks off. The woman thanks you fervently, shuddering at what might have happened had you not come when you did.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere beyond the city, a familiar voice observes that all’s well that ends well, and Thancred steps into view with a roguish smile, telling you that you meet again. He asks that you not mistake his intent—he insists it is always honorable—but admits that he has been watching you ever since you departed Ul’dah as envoy. He says you played the part to perfection: confident as a woman on a diplomatic mission should be, yet never failing to show proper courtesy to your betters. When your journey led you into danger, you faced it without flinching, and he calls you quite a marvel, confessing he is rather taken with you. More than anything, he was struck by your readiness to aid those in need even when you could expect nothing but words in return; in this day and age, he says, such selflessness is rare. All of this leads him to conclude that you are the adventurer he has been searching for—one possessed of a very rare set of qualities. He freely admits that your rescue of the damsel in distress was more a happy accident than a planned feat, but insists that what matters is that you saved her. Then his tone shifts as he mentions a certain talent of yours: your visions. You have been experiencing them, have you not? As it happens, he knows a woman who shares that gift and can help you understand it. The two of them belong to the same organization, and both would be delighted beyond words if you would agree to join their cause. Naturally, he explains, there are benefits to being part of such a collective; for one, they would gladly help you realize your potential as an adventurer. He does not ask for an answer on the spot, instead urging you to think on it, and says that if you feel moved to help—as he prays you shall—you should speak with Momodi, the ever-lovely and youthful mistress of the Quicksand. Tell her that the Scions of the Seventh Dawn have found their woman, he says, and she will tell you where to find them.</p>
      <p>Back at the Quicksand, Momodi remarks that scenes like the one you just witnessed are becoming ever more common, but tells you not to worry—if you work hard, you will probably be all right. Should you ever find yourself in real trouble, she says, you need only come and see her, though she teases you not to pester her over every scraped knee, even if she does enjoy hearing of a gentleman’s woes with the womenfolk from time to time. She then notices you properly and apologizes for keeping you waiting, explaining that she was just giving guidance to an adventurer fresh off the carriage, before exclaiming how good it is to see you safe and well; looking at you, no one would ever guess that you were locked in battle with giants in the dark. She insists she never doubted for a moment that you would succeed—and neither did Papashan—and says the stationmaster will be overjoyed when he hears the news. You are every ilm the adventurer Miounne said you were. Before she forgets, Momodi mentions that there is a lass who wants a word with you. The girl did not know your name, she says, but from the description it was obvious who she meant. The young woman introduces herself as Edda and nervously thanks you for sparing the time, admitting that you do not know her, but that she has long wished to speak with you. She explains that she is an adventurer like you, though not a very good one, and tells you how she was in Gridania with her friends when the leader of their party was killed. His name was Avere, and the two of them were to be wed in the spring. You may not remember him, she says, but he remembered you all too well; he would sing your praises from dawn to dusk, having seen you for what you are—an adventurer’s adventurer—and he swore he would be like you one day. After he was slain by a fiend, Edda thought long and hard about giving up adventuring, but whenever she thinks of the person you are and all that you have achieved, she finds herself inspired, just as Avere once was. She has decided to start again as an adventurer, to return to the village of her birth and begin her training anew—but before she leaves, she wanted to meet you and ask your name. When you give it, she repeats “Forename Surname,” promising she will not forget, and thanks you once more. She prays that you will meet again someday, and bids you farewell.</p>
      <p>As Edda departs, Momodi remarks that adventuring can be a cruel, bloody business, and confesses that once she could not understand why anyone would bother. When she was first asked to take charge of the guild at the Quicksand, she wanted nothing to do with adventurers at all, convinced it would be a royal pain looking after you lot. Yet against her better judgment she accepted the post, and now she could not be gladder that she did; she feels privileged to be part of your lives, she says—and that goes double for yours, Forename. When you then ask her about the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, she realizes that they are beginning to move in earnest. The Scions are no ordinary folk, she explains, and the work they do is no ordinary work; she knows full well how capable you are, but even you would think twice about attempting some of the tasks they take on. Knowing that, if you are still certain that you want to be involved, she promises to tell you what she can.</p>

      <p>クイックサンドにいるモモディが「そろそろ依頼人が来る頃だよ」と呟いた矢先、灼熱の太陽の下からひとりの老人が転がり込むように酒場へ飛び込んでくる。彼は「もう一瞬でもあの陽射しを浴びていたら燃え上がっていたところだ」と大げさに嘆きながら、冷えたエールを一杯頼む。その男こそ、モモディが「ちょうど良いところに来たね」と声をかけたパパシャーンであり、彼女は、ちょうど依頼を引き受けてくれる冒険者が店に来ているのだと紹介する。あなたの姿を認めたパパシャーンは、驚きと喜びを滲ませながら「おお、我が友フォルネームではないか」と声を上げ、自分たちを助けてくれるのがあなたであることに、何よりも心強さを覚えると語る。そして改めて、自らを元王宮騎士団サルタンサーン所属のパパシャーンと名乗り、力を貸してくれることに礼を述べる。モモディに促されて本題に入った彼は、この嘆願がアマジナ鉱山社に勤める知人から出されたものであり、問題はカッパーベル銅山で起きていると説明する。端的に言えば、鉱山が巨人族に占拠されてしまったのだという。その巨人族は「ヘカトンケイル」と呼ばれる一族であり、かつてソーン朝の時代に、鉱山の最深部に封じられた恐るべき存在であった。それが、長きにわたって彼らを閉じ込めていた岩盤を破り、いまや鉱夫が働く坑道を我が物顔で徘徊しているのだ。先祖による扱いへの怒りはもっともであり、その結果として採掘作業は完全に停止している。モモディはそれを聞き、ソーン朝が終焉を迎えたのは三百年以上も前のことだと口にし、改めて巨人族の怒りの深さに思いを馳せる。パパシャーンは彼女の博識を称えつつ、当時の人々がヘカトンケイルたちに魔法を施した兜を被せ、鉱山労働の奴隷として使役していた過去を語る。だが、そうした物語によくあるように、やがてその魔法は解け、奴隷たちは主人に反旗を翻した。先祖たちは暴走する巨人族の怒りを押さえ込むため、カッパーベル銅山の最下層を崩落させるという苦渋の策を選び、「巨人族大反乱」を、十万トンズもの岩の下に葬り去ったのだ。最近になって、モモディはミスリルアイ紙の記事で、需要の高まりを受けてカッパーベル銅山が再開されると読んだことを思い出し、「きっと掘り進みすぎて、眠っていた巨人族を解き放ってしまったんだろうね」と推測する。三世紀もの間生き延びた彼らが、どれほどの怨嗟を募らせているかを思うと、まさに「煮えたぎる怒り」としか言いようがない。パパシャーンも、その怒りは我々すべてにとって脅威であり、巨人族を放置したままでは採掘再開など望むべくもないと同意する。平穏と繁栄のためにも、彼らを鎮めねばならない──それが、あなたに託したい任務だと彼は告げる。危険に満ちた任務であることを否定はしないが、それでもどうか、この忌まわしい事態に終止符を打ってほしいと懇願するのだった。あなたがためらうことなく承諾すると、彼は安堵の息を吐き、「きっとこれが最善の道だ」と力強く頷く。モモディは、カッパーベル銅山が西ザナラーンにあることを伝え、道中に十分気をつけるよう念を押す。パパシャーンはさらに、アマジナ鉱山社の従業員であるペインテッド・メサという男が今まさにクイックサンドに来ており、カッパーベル銅山に詳しいので、出発前に彼の話を聞いておくとよいと助言する。</p>
      <p>パパシャーンの忠告に従い、あなたはクイックサンドでペインテッド・メサを探す。「ペインテッド・メサを探しているのか？」と彼は自ら名乗り、あなたがカッパーベル銅山の件に志願した冒険者であると知ると、その度胸を認めつつも、「腕前のほうも、それに見合っていてほしいものだ」と苦笑する。鉱山は採掘を再開してから一週間も経たないうちに、ヘカトンケイルたちの手によって見るも無残な有様になってしまったのだという。ペインテッド・メサは、カッパーベル銅山が第二ウル朝がまだ若い頃にはすでに「古い鉱山」と呼ばれていたこと、そして何世紀も前に放棄された場所であることを語る。本来ならば、ウルダハ復興のための建築資材が不足しなければ、アマジナ鉱山社が再開を検討することもなかったはずだ。しかし、巨人族の存在を承知のうえで、計画は強行された。三百年もの間、山ほどの岩に埋もれていたのだから、何も生き残っているはずがない──誰もがそう考えていたのだ。だが、それは大きな誤算だった。鉱夫たちがツルハシを振るったその先に、眠りから目覚めた巨人族がいたのである。ヘカトンケイルたちを鎮めないかぎり、この国の輝かしい復興は、建材不足によってたちまち行き詰まってしまうだろう。今は、ストーン・トーチの面々が鉱山入口を見張り、巨人族が外の陽の光や新鮮な空気を求めて出てこないか警戒している。中に入るときは、彼らの誰かが案内役を務めてくれるはずだ。最後にペインテッド・メサは、「この国の希望はあんたの肩にかかっている」と真剣な目で告げ、三百年ぶりに解き放たれた巨人たちを「七つの地獄」のいずれかへ叩き返してきてくれと託すのだった。</p>
      <p>やがてあなたは西ザナラーンのホライズン周辺へと向かい、ランドマークとしてそびえるカッパーベル銅山の姿を目にする。その付近では、すでに別の一行が犠牲となった痕跡があり、アリアンとイゼルドゥールが調査に当たっていた。アリアンは、ドロレスベアとその仲間たちが皆殺しにされているのを発見したと語り、巨人族の徹底した仕業であったことを告げる。足跡などの状況から判断するに、彼らは大群の巨人族に対して突撃を敢行したようだが、なぜ熟練の一団がそこまで無謀な行動に出たのか、その理由は定かではない。ただ、彼女には薄々心当たりがあった。人はしばしば自分自身に対して最も厳しく、過去の成果を上回ろうとするあまり、冷静な判断を失い、無謀さに拍車をかけてしまう――目標を持つことは大切だが、それだけに囚われ、他のすべてを顧みなくなれば、いつか必ず代償を払うことになるのだ、と。ドロレスベアたちがまさにその一例であると、彼女は静かに嘆く。傍らのイゼルドゥールは、長年冒険者として生き、多くの歴史的な瞬間を目の当たりにしてきたが、時代が変わろうとも「冒険」という営みの本質は変わらないと語る。それは、己の意思で選び取った試練を通じて自分を高めていく旅であり続けてきたし、これからもそうであり続けるだろう、と。経験を積んだ冒険者は、自然と正義を愛し、自己犠牲の精神を理解するようになる。その経験は数値で測れるものではないが、旅の途上で重ねてきた選択と、その結果の良し悪しのすべてが、確かにその人物を形作っていくのだ。彼は、そんな話の締めくくりとして、あなたをまっすぐに見つめ、「君の内には眩い光がある。その光が教えてくれるのだ、君が偉大な存在になる運命にあるのだと」と告げるのだった。</p>
      <p>鉱山入口に立つストーン・トーチの隊士は、カッパーベル銅山内部で異変が発生し、その影響を封じ込めるために自分たちがここに配備されているのだと説明し、あなたにも安全のため近づかないよう忠告する。ところが、あなたが自ら名乗り、ヘカトンケイル討伐に志願した冒険者であると告げると、隊士は目を見開き、「パパシャーン殿がこんなにも早く、いや、そもそも人を見つけられるとは思っていなかった」と驚きを隠さない。今のところ巨人族は鉱山内で暴れ回ることに満足しているようだが、いずれ外に出ようと考えるのは時間の問題であり、手を打つならば一刻も早いほうがいい、と彼は続ける。できる限りの準備を整え、覚悟ができたら、いつでも坑道へと入ってくれ──その間、自分たちストーン・トーチはここで警戒を続け、もし敵があなたをすり抜けようとしたならば、それを止める覚悟だと約束する。あなたは任務用の「コンテンツファインダー」を通じてカッパーベル銅山の内部へと足を踏み入れ、かつて「巨人族大反乱」を起こしたヘカトンケイルたちと対峙する。激しい戦いの末に彼らを鎮め、無事に坑道から生還したあなたは、ウルダハへと戻り、再びクイックサンドの扉をくぐる。そこでペインテッド・メサは、「カッパーベルの征服者が帰ってきた」と嬉しそうに出迎え、あなたのおかげで採掘作業が再開でき、ウルダハの復興に必要な資材が確保できると感謝の言葉を述べる。この国全体が、あなたに負っている借りは計り知れない、と。彼は、次にパパシャーンと会ったときには必ずこの朗報を伝えると約束し、その前にモモディへ報告に行くよう勧める。あなたが無事な姿を見せれば、あの女将もさぞかし喜ぶに違いない、と笑みを浮かべるのだった。</p>
      <p>ほどなくして、ナル回廊の通りでは、ひときわ大きな叫び声が響き渡る。「やめてくれぇ！」という悲鳴に振り向けば、ひとりの難民風の女性が「厚かましい商人」に絡まれている場面に出くわす。男は「盗人め」と罵りながら、彼女が高級なドードー肉を盗んだと決めつける。震えながら否定する女性は、自分は何も盗んでおらず、手持ちのギルで正当に購入したのだと訴えるが、商人はそれを「難民にこんな上等な肉が買えるはずがない」と一蹴し、「本来なら銅刃団に突き出してやるところだが、街の治安のためにもな」と脅しをかける。そして、あくまで自分は情け深い男だと言わんばかりに、「その代わり、ある“務め”を果たしてくれるなら、不問にしてやってもいい」と、下卑た取り引きを持ちかけるのだった。女性は、十二神に誓って自分は潔白だと叫び、たまたまその場に居合わせた冒険者であるあなたへ助けを求める。コツコツ貯めたギルでようやく肉を買い、子どもたちに久しぶりのまともな食事を食べさせたかっただけなのだと、涙ながらに訴える彼女の姿に、あなたは迷わず一歩踏み出す。すると商人は、「何者だ、お前は？　この犬の飼い主か？」と言わんばかりにあなたを罵り、「茶番はもうたくさんだ。お前ら、こいつらにお灸を据えてやれ！」と用心棒たちに命じる。こうして小競り合いは戦いへと発展し、酔っ払いの用心棒が「この程度の相手、俺ひとりで十分だ」とばかりに前に出てくる。酒臭い息を吐きながら「血を流せ」と凄んでみせるものの、ほどなくしてあなたの実力の前に押され始め、「七杯目のエールで止めておくべきだった」と愚痴をこぼす。戦況が決定的になると、仲間たちも「こんな報酬じゃ割に合わねぇ」と尻尾を巻いて逃げ出し、商人が怒鳴り声をあげても振り返りもしない。乱闘が終わると、女性は何度も何度もあなたに礼を述べるのだった。</p>
      <p>その瞬間、「エコー」の力が働き、あなたの意識は遠くの光景へと引き寄せられる。気がつけば、中央ザナラーンの「スピノレス盆地」に立ち、ふたりの市民の会話を見守る透明な傍観者となっていた。ひとりの若い男は、最近難民の数が増えたように感じると呟き、それに対して年長の男は「気のせいではない」と応じる。彼の説明によれば、大災害の直後こそいくつかの集落は生き残ったものの、やがて土地はやせ細り、あるいは交易路から切り離されるなど、簡単には解決できない問題に見舞われたのだという。人々はなんとかやりくりを続けたが、いずれ限界が訪れ、故郷を捨てて都市へと新たな生活を求めざるを得なくなったのだ。若者が「他の都市国家でも同じようなことが起こっているのか」と問うと、年長の男は「噂が本当なら、そうだろう」と答えつつも、ウルダハは特に繁栄しているという評判があるため、まずはここに望みを託す者が多いのだろうと付け加える。若者は難民たちに同情を寄せながらも、治安が悪化しないか不安を隠せない様子で、彼らの存在が犯罪を生み出すのではないかと懸念を口にする。年長の男は、もし事態が悪化したとしても、不滅隊がおり、銅刃団も彼らの助力を歓迎するだろうと答える。かつてガレマール帝国と戦った英雄たちが、必要とあらば街を巡回し、不穏分子を取り締まることになるかもしれない──それほど状況は深刻なのだと。とはいえ、すべての難民が悪人というわけではなく、真面目に働き、誠実な生活を送っている者たちもいるのだと強調する。そこへ、調子のいい売り子が「ドードーの上ロース、ザナラーン最安の品だよ！」と声を張り上げ、客に礼を述べる姿が目に入り、一見するとウルダハは順調に復興しているようにも見える。しかし年長の男は、「繁栄という仮面の裏には、尽きることのない苦しみと悲しみが横たわっている」と静かに告げるのだった。ここでエコーの幻視は薄れ、あなたは再びナル回廊の通りに戻ってくる。目の前では、先ほどの女性が恐る恐る「大丈夫ですか？」とあなたの様子を窺い、一方で商人は、「今度は善良な市民を脅すつもりか」と被害者を装い、誰かが彼女の支払いを目撃したという主張を「馬鹿げている」と一蹴しようとする。しかし、周囲から「確かに自分も見ていたぞ」「その女を放っておけ、このハゲタカめ！」といった声が上がり、彼女の無実を証言する者たちが次々に現れる。商人は「誰だ、今のは！」と怒鳴り散らすものの、支持を得られないと悟るや、「今回は見逃してやる」と捨て台詞を残して去っていく。女性は、もしあなたがいなかったら、あの男に何をされていたかわからないと身震いしながら、改めて深く感謝の言葉を述べるのだった。</p>
      <p>その少し後、街の外れで「終わりよければすべてよし、ってところかな」と軽口まじりの声が響き、振り向いたあなたの前にサンクレッドが姿を現す。「また会ったね」と言う彼は、「誤解のないように言っておくが、俺の意図は常に高潔なものだ」と前置きしつつ、ウルダハを発ってからずっと、あなたのことを見ていたと打ち明ける。彼は、使者として各地を巡ったあなたが、自信に満ちつつも上位者に対しては礼節を忘れず、旅の途上で危険に身を投じることになっても一切怯むことなく立ち向かった姿を称え、「まさに外交任務を担う女性として理想的な振る舞いだった」と絶賛する。そして、「こんな時代に、見返りも言葉ばかりだというのに、困っている者のために躊躇なく手を差し伸べる」その姿勢こそが、何よりも心を打ったのだと明かす。そんな利他的な精神は、今の世では極めて稀なものだと。こうした一連の振る舞いから、彼はあなたがずっと探し求めていた冒険者──非常に珍しい資質を備えた人物であると確信するに至ったという。もっとも、さきほどの「困窮する女性の救出」は、どちらかと言えば偶然の産物であったかもしれないが、それでも結果として彼女を救ったことに変わりはないと、彼は微笑を浮かべて言葉を添える。そこでサンクレッドは、話題をあなたの「幻視」に移す。最近、何度か不思議な光景を見ているだろう、と言い当て、「実は君と同じ力を持つ女がいて、その力について理解を深める手助けをしてくれるはずだ」と告げる。彼とその女性は同じ組織に属しており、もしあなたが彼らの活動に加わってくれるなら、これほど嬉しいことはないとも言う。もちろん、そうした集団に属するメリットもあり、冒険者としての潜在能力を伸ばす手助けも喜んでしてくれるだろう、と彼は約束する。今すぐ返事を求めるつもりはないが、もし彼らの手助けをしたいという気持ちになったなら──できれば、そうなってほしいと祈りつつ──ウルダハの若き女将モモディに話を聞いてほしいと頼む。そして、「暁の血盟が求めていた“女”を見つけたと伝えてくれ」と言い残し、サンクレッドはその場を去っていくのだった。</p>
      <p>クイックサンドに戻ると、モモディは、先ほど目にしたような騒ぎが最近は増えているのだと少し険しい表情で語り、「でも、ちゃんと働いていれば、多分大丈夫さ」とあなたを安心させる。もし本当に困ったことがあれば、いつでも自分のところへ来ればいい、と言いつつも、「ただし、ちょっと膝をすりむいた程度で泣きついてこられても困るけどね」と冗談めかして笑う。ときには、男の恋愛相談を聞くのも嫌いじゃないけどさ、と軽口を叩いたあと、ようやくあなたの姿をまじまじと眺め、「巨人相手にあれだけやり合ってきたとは思えないくらい、元気そうじゃないか」と心からの安堵を口にする。あなたが無事に任務を果たして戻ってくることを、彼女は一瞬たりとも疑わなかったし、パパシャーンも同じ気持ちだったはずだと微笑み、「駅長殿も、この知らせを聞いたらさぞかし喜ぶだろうね」と続ける。あなたは、ミューヌが語っていたとおり、一イルムの狂いもなく冒険者らしい冒険者だと太鼓判を押されるのだった。そこでふと思い出したように、モモディは「そうそう、あんたに話がしたいって娘がいるんだ」と切り出す。名前までは知らなかったようだが、その娘の人となりを聞けば、誰のことかすぐにわかったと笑う。やがて、緊張した面持ちの若い女性が近づいてきて、自分の名をエッダと名乗り、あなたが時間を割いてくれたことにおずおずと礼を述べる。あなたは彼女のことを知らないかもしれないが、彼女のほうはずっと前からあなたに話しかけたいと思っていたのだという。エッダは、自分もあなたと同じ冒険者ではあるものの、正直あまり上手くやれてはいないと打ち明ける。そして、仲間たちとともにグリダニア周辺で冒険をしていたとき、パーティーリーダーが命を落としてしまったのだと語る。その名はアヴェル。春には結婚する約束をしていた相手だった。あなたは彼のことを覚えていないかもしれないが、彼のほうはあなたのことを忘れることなど決してなかった、とエッダは続ける。彼は朝から晩まで、あなたの武勇を称え、あなたこそ「冒険者の中の冒険者」だと言っては、自分もいつかあなたのようになりたいと誓っていたのだという。あの忌まわしい魔物に奪われなければ、きっとその夢に手が届いていたはずだと、彼女は悔しそうに唇を噛む。アヴェルの死後、エッダは何度も冒険者を辞めようかと考えたが、それでもあなたという人物と、そのこれまでの歩みを思い浮かべると、不思議と心が奮い立ち、再び前を向く勇気が湧いてくるのだと打ち明ける。だからこそ、彼女はもう一度冒険者としてやり直す覚悟を決めた。生まれ故郷の村へ戻り、一から修行を積み直すつもりだという。ただ、その前にどうしてもあなたに会い、名前を直接聞いておきたかったのだと、エッダは恥ずかしそうに目を伏せる。あなたが名乗ると、彼女は「フォルネーム・サーネーム」とその名をそっと繰り返し、「決して忘れません」と胸に刻む。改めて深く礼を述べると、いつかまた必ず会えるよう祈りながら、エッダはその場を後にするのだった。</p>
      <p>エッダの背中を見送りながら、モモディは「冒険者稼業ってのは、まったくもって残酷な商売だよ」とぽつりと漏らす。かつては、どうして好き好んでそんな道を選ぶのか理解できず、クイックサンドのギルド運営を任せたいと持ちかけられたときも、「面倒ごとの塊みたいな連中の世話なんて、まっぴらごめんだ」と断るつもりだったと笑い話のように語る。しかし、自分の直感に反してその役目を引き受けることにし、今では心の底から良かったと思っていると続ける。冒険者たちの人生の一端に関わることができるのは光栄なことであり、なかでもあなたの歩みに関われることは、その「二倍」特別だと、照れ隠しに小さく笑いながら言葉を添える。そんな折、あなたが「暁の血盟」について尋ねると、モモディは小さく息を呑み、「いよいよ本格的に動き始めたみたいだね」と表情を引き締める。彼女によれば、暁の血盟は普通の人々とはまったく異なる存在であり、その活動内容もまた常軌を逸しているという。あなたの腕前がどれほど確かなものであろうと、彼らが請け負う仕事の中には、誰であっても二の足を踏むようなものが少なくない。それでもなお、その一員として関わりたいと本気で思うのであれば、その覚悟を踏まえたうえで、自分の知る限りのことを教えるつもりだと約束してくれるのだった。</p>

      <p>就在 Momodi 說著「委託人差不多也該到了吧」的時候，一位老人從 Ul’dah 毒辣的日頭底下跌跌撞撞地闖進 The Quicksand，一邊大叫再多待一秒就要被太陽烤成灰，一邊急著點了一杯冰涼的麥酒。這位老人正是 Papashan。Momodi 立刻迎上前，說他來得正巧，因為願意接下他委託的冒險者已經在這裡了。Papashan 一看到你，眼睛一亮，高興地喊出「原來是我的好朋友 Forename 啊」，坦言由你來幫忙，讓他心裡踏實了許多。接著他正經地自我介紹，說自己曾是 Sultansworn 的一員，如今以 Papashan 的名義向你致謝，感激你願意伸出援手。在 Momodi 的提醒下，他把話題拉回正事，說這份請願是由 Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern 的一位熟人提出，牽涉到 Copperbell Mines 發生的不幸事件：整座礦山被巨人奪走了控制權。那群巨人正是名為 hecatoncheires 的一族，是在 Thorne Dynasty 時代，被封印在礦山最深處的可怕存在。如今，他們似乎已經突破了封印的岩層，在礦工作業的坑道中橫行，對祖先對待他們的方式怒不可遏，迫使所有採礦作業全面停止。Momodi 聽到這裡，想起 Thorne Dynasty 早在三百多年前就滅亡了，愈發能想像這些巨人累積的怨恨有多深。Papashan 稱讚她記性好，接著補充那段黑暗歷史：當時的人們給 hecatoncheires 戴上附魔頭盔，將他們當成奴隸，驅使進礦坑裡工作。可想而知，那種魔法終有一天會失效，一旦控制崩潰，奴隸們便起身反叛。為了壓制這些巨人狂怒的反撲，先人做出痛苦的決定，誘導 Copperbell Mines 最底層崩塌，讓所謂的「Great Giant Revolt」埋葬在無數岩石之下。最近，Momodi 又回想起在《Mythril Eye》上看到的一篇文章：為了滿足日漸攀升的建材需求，Copperbell Mines 正在重新開採。她忍不住推測，是不是礦工們挖得太深，誤把封印解開了。想到那些可憐的巨人被壓在山底活了三百年，怨念一路累積到現在，她只覺得「一定氣得發狂」。Papashan 同意，說這樣的怒火對所有人都是威脅，只要 hecatoncheires 還在，Copperbell 就不可能重新運作。為了和平與繁榮，必須設法將他們鎮壓。這就是他希望託付給你的任務。他並不否認這趟差事非常危險，但仍然懇求你替大家畫下句點──而當你毫不猶豫地接受時，他明顯鬆了一口氣，堅信這確實是最好的選擇。Momodi 叮嚀你，Copperbell Mines 位在 Western Thanalan，路上務必小心，而 Papashan 則補充，Amajina & Sons 目前有名員工 Painted Mesa 正待在 The Quicksand，他對那座礦山非常熟悉，建議你出發前先聽聽他的意見。</p>
      <p>你照著 Papashan 的建議，在酒館裡尋找 Painted Mesa。他很乾脆地承認自己就是那個人，得知你是自願接下 Copperbell 事件的冒險者後，先是佩服你的膽識，又半開玩笑地說希望你的本事也跟膽量一樣可靠，因為下面的情況可一點也不樂觀：自從重新開始開採以來，才不到一週，整座礦山就已經被 hecatoncheires 搞得亂七八糟。Painted Mesa 接著說，Copperbell 在第二個 Ul 王朝還年輕時就已經被稱作「老礦山」，而且幾百年前就被放棄了；若不是為了 Ul’dah 重建工程急缺建材，Amajina & Sons 根本不會考慮重新開採。至於巨人的存在，他們當然一開始就知道，但工程仍然照樣進行──畢竟，誰會相信有什麼東西可以在三百年的山崩之下還活著？事實證明，他們想錯了。礦工多揮了幾下鎬子，就在岩層後頭把熟睡的巨人挖了出來。若不能儘早鎮壓 hecatoncheires，國家的重建就會因為缺少石材與礦產而停滯不前。現在，Stone Torches 正在礦坑入口把守，提防巨人突然想要出來曬太陽、吹吹風；到時會有其中一人帶你進去。最後，Painted Mesa 語氣一沉，說整個國家的希望都壓在你肩上，拜託你把那些巨人送回他們逃出來的七重地獄裡去。</p>
      <p>接下這份重責之後，你從 Ul’dah 出發，沿著 Thanalan 的大地一路西行，來到 Horizon’s Edge 上方那座顯眼的地標──Copperbell Mines。礦坑周圍有小隊正在調查失敗的攻略痕跡，Alianne 告訴你，她們發現 Dolorous Bear 和他整個小隊都已喪命，巨人的手段極為徹底，連反抗的痕跡都顯得悲慘。從地上的腳印與亂成一團的痕跡來看，那支隊伍似乎選擇了「硬衝巨人群」這條路。Alianne 不確定究竟是什麼逼得這群老練的冒險者如此衝動，但她心裡並不是毫無頭緒：人往往是自己最嚴苛的評審，總想超越過去的自己，結果在這股壓力底下，反而失去冷靜，做出魯莽的決定。她感嘆，如果一個人只盯著「超越前次成績」這個目標，看不到其他任何東西，終究會付出代價，就像 Dolorous Bear 一行人今日的結局。另一邊的 Isildaure 則以老冒險者的角度說，他已經見證過許多歷史上的關鍵時刻，雖然時代會變，冒險者這份「工作」的本質卻從未改變：無論何時，它始終都是一條透過主動挑戰，磨鍊自我的道路。隨著歲月推進，真正的冒險者自然會培養出對「正義」的渴望，也會理解「自我犧牲」的重量。這樣的經驗沒辦法用任何具體數字衡量，卻會確實影響一個人是誰──因為那是由一路上每個選擇，以及那些選擇帶來的好壞結果堆疊而成。說到這裡，Isildaure 認真地看向你，說他在你身上看見一道光，那道光告訴他，你將來必定會成就非凡。</p>
      <p>來到礦坑入口時，一名 Stone Torch 守衛攔下你，告訴你 Copperbell Mines 內部發生事故，他們奉命在此封鎖局勢，勸你為了自身安全最好別靠近。當你表明身分，說自己就是自願前來鎮壓 hecatoncheires 的冒險者時，他顯得相當驚訝，坦承自己沒想到 Papashan 能這麼快──甚至說得誇張一點，是「真的能」找到願意接下這種任務的人。守衛說，目前巨人還把破壞力發洩在礦坑裡，但要不了多久，他們肯定會想到走出來看看外面的太陽與新鮮空氣；越早處理越好。他要你在這裡整備好一切，準備妥當後就隨時可以進坑，並保證 Stone Torches 會持續在外頭守望，如果有敵人想趁你不注意溜出去，他們也會擋下來。做好心理準備後，你透過 Duty Finder 進入 Copperbell Mines，深入那座曾經因「Great Giant Revolt」而崩塌的地底，與 hecatoncheires 正面交鋒。經過一番激戰，你終於將威脅壓制，平安踏出礦坑，再回到 Ul’dah 的 The Quicksand。Painted Mesa 把你稱作「Copperbell 的征服者」，滿臉是笑地迎接你，說多虧有你，礦山作業得以恢復，Ul’dah 也終於能拿到重建急需的建材。整個國家都欠了你一份人情。他說，下次見到 Papashan 時一定會把這個好消息轉告，至於你，則應該先去找 Momodi 回報，讓那位老闆娘親眼確認你安然無恙，她一定會很高興。</p>
      <p>不久之後，在 Ul’dah - Steps of Nald 的街道上，你聽見一聲淒厲的「不要啊！」，循聲望去，只見一位打扮寒酸的婦人被一名 Obnoxious Merchant 抓住，對方正惡狠狠地罵她是偷東西的豬，指控她偷走了自己高價的 dodo 肉。那名 Desperate Damsel 渾身發抖，不停否認，說自己什麼都沒偷，是用辛苦攢來的錢買的肉。然而商人根本不把她的話當回事，冷笑說像她這樣的難民連發霉的鼴鼠肉都買不起，更別說這種上等 dodo 了。他威脅說按理應該把她交給 Brass Blades，替市民維護街道治安，但自己是個「通情達理」的人，只要她願意在他身邊「好好服侍一陣子」，這件事就可以當作沒發生過。婦人含著淚，對著 Twelve 發誓自己清白，這時看見你，立刻向你求救，說那塊肉是她拿多日積蓄買的，只是想讓孩子們好好吃上一頓。你上前介入，Obnoxious Merchant 立刻轉而把怒火撒向你，質疑你是誰、是不是替這條「狗」出頭，隨即表示自己受夠這場鬧劇，命令身邊的保鑣「好好教訓你們一頓」。Duty 就此展開，一名 Filthy Bodyguard 步履蹣跚地走上前，嘴裡還有酒氣，自信滿滿地說其他人只要在旁邊看戲就好，由他一人解決你。他邊打邊用粗話叫你流血，卻很快就被你打得節節敗退，中途還抱怨自己不該喝到第七杯麥酒。當戰況明顯對你有利時，其餘同伴也開始退縮，覺得這點報酬根本不值得冒這種險，索性轉身落跑。商人朝他們大喊，卻沒人回頭。戰鬥結束後，Desperate Damsel 一再向你道謝，語氣裡全是後怕。</p>
      <p>就在那一刻，Echo 的力量啟動，你的意識被拉離現場，來到 Central Thanalan 的 Spineless Basin，成為旁觀者，聽著兩名市民談論難民潮。一名年輕人看著聚集的人影，感覺最近難民好像變多了，旁邊那位年紀稍長的市民則說他的感覺沒錯，接著解釋 Calamity 剛發生時，確實有不少村落撐過了第一波衝擊，但後來土地變得貧瘠，有些地方與既有貿易路線斷絕，這種問題不是短時間就能解決的。居民們努力撐了一段時間，最後仍不得不放棄家園，到城市裡尋找新的生活。年輕人問，整個 realm 不都受到 Calamity 影響嗎？其他都市是不是也在經歷同樣的事。對方說，照坊間的說法，的確如此，只是 Ul’dah 一向被認為是繁榮之都，難民自然會先來這裡碰碰運氣。年輕人說自己很同情他們，但也坦言心裡難免不安，擔心這股人口流入會讓城裡治安惡化。年長者則說，就算情況真的惡化了，至少還有 Immortal Flames 這股力量，只要有需要，Brass Blades 多半也會樂於接受支援──那些曾經對抗 Garlean Empire 的英雄們，或許有一天真的得在街上巡邏，清理亂源。接著他又補充，並不是所有難民都會走向犯罪，有些人也找到工作，過著踏實的生活。這時，一名叫賣的 Sure-voiced Salesman 在一旁高聲吆喝，說自家的 dodo 里肌是整個 Thanalan 最便宜的，還熱情地向客人道謝。乍看之下，Ul’dah 仿佛已經走在復甦的路上，但年長者提醒，若是稍微掀開表面那層「繁榮」的面具，就會發現底下依舊是看不見盡頭的痛苦與苦難。畫面隨之淡去，你從 Echo 中回神，再次回到 Ul’dah 的街上，只見先前那位婦人有些擔心地問你是不是沒事。Obnoxious Merchant 則立刻搶著發話，裝出一副「守法市民」的模樣，質問你是不是打算威脅一個手無寸鐵的人，還說有人看見她買肉的說法簡直荒謬。話音未落，周圍就傳來幾個旁觀者的聲音，說自己也親眼看見交易，叫他放過那可憐的女人，還罵他是「吸血禿鷹」。商人又氣又慌，怒吼著要知道是誰說的話，但在發現現場沒人願意替他說話後，只好咬牙切齒地丟下一句「這次就算了」，悻悻然離開。Desperate Damsel 連連向你致謝，說若不是你出手相救，她實在不敢想像事情會變成什麼樣子。</p>
      <p>之後不久，你在城外聽見一聲輕快的感嘆：「總之，能落個皆大歡喜的結局也不錯嘛。」回頭一看，Thancred 正帶著他一貫的笑容向你走來，說「我們又見面了」。他一開始先澄清，別誤會，他的意圖一向光明正大，但從你離開 Ul’dah 擔任 envoy 那時起，他就一直留意著你的動向。他說，你在外交任務中扮演 envoy 的表現堪稱完美：對外展現出的自信毫不遜色，面對「地位較高的人物」時也始終保持禮貌；旅途途中遭遇危險時，你也從未退縮。他直言，你的表現簡直令人讚嘆，甚至坦白說自己已經有些被你吸引住了。不過，他最在意的還是另一點──哪怕明知道最後能得到的報酬只有簡單的一句謝謝，你仍然願意伸出援手，幫助需要幫助的人。這種無私的舉動在這個時代已經非常少見。正是因為這一連串的行為，他才會認定你就是他一直在尋找的那種冒險者，身上擁有非常罕見的特質。他也坦承，剛才救下那位 Desperate Damsel 或許在某種程度上是「意外之舉」，但結果就是你救了人，這才是真正重要的。說到這裡，Thancred 把話題帶到你的「visions」──那些你近日不時看到的幻象。他問你是不是已經意識到自己擁有這份能力，接著說，其實他認識一位同樣擁有這種天賦的女性，可以幫助你理解這個力量。他和那位女性同屬一個組織，如果你願意加入他們的行列，他們會非常歡迎。身為這個組織的一員，當然也會有不少好處，其中之一，就是他們會樂於協助你發揮身為冒險者的潛力。他並沒有要你立刻做出決定，而是要你先好好思考。如果哪一天你覺得自己也想幫助他們──他真心希望那一天會到來──就去找 The Quicksand 的老闆娘 Momodi，告訴她「Scions of the Seventh Dawn 已經找到合適的人選了」。聽到這句話，Momodi 就會告訴你如何找到他們。</p>
      <p>當你回到 The Quicksand 時，Momodi 正在感嘆，像你剛剛在街上看到那種場面，最近出現得越來越頻繁。她讓你別太擔心，只要肯努力工作，多半不會出什麼大問題；如果真的遇上什麼難以招架的麻煩，就來找她，不過也別每次擦破皮就跑來哭訴，雖然偶爾聽聽男人的感情煩惱她還是挺樂在其中的。說笑過後，她才真正打量你一番，為你毫髮無傷地站在眼前而開心，說若只是看外表，誰也想不到你剛剛還在黑暗的礦坑裡跟巨人拼命。她表示自己從來沒懷疑過你會成功，Papashan 也一樣，相信你一定辦得到。等 stationmaster 聽到這個消息，一定會高興得不得了。Momodi 說，你完全就是 Miounne 口中那種「冒險者中的冒險者」。接著，她突然想起來，說店裡有個女孩一直想找你說話。那姑娘其實連你的名字都不知道，但光是描述外貌和經歷，她就立刻知道對方指的是你。那名年輕女子怯生生地走上前，自稱 Edda，先謝謝你願意抽空聽她說話，承認你其實不認識她，但她早就一直想和你聊聊。Edda 說自己跟你一樣是冒險者，只是做得並不算好。她提到，之前跟朋友們在 Gridania 一帶冒險時，隊伍的領隊在一次任務中喪命。那人名叫 Avere，本來預定在春天與她成婚。你或許不記得他，但他對你的印象卻深得不得了，從早到晚都在誇獎你，把你視為真正的「冒險者典範」，說自己總有一天也要成為像你一樣的人。Edda 相信，如果不是被怪物奪走性命，Avere 真的有機會實現他的願望。自那之後，她多次想過乾脆放棄冒險者這條路，但每當她想到你這個人，以及你一路走來的成果，就會像當初的 Avere 一樣再次被鼓舞，覺得也許自己還能再試一次。於是，她下定決心要重新出發，回到自己的出生村莊，從頭開始鍛鍊自己。不過在此之前，她想先見你一面，親自問問你的名字。當你說出自己的全名時，她輕聲重複了一遍「Forename Surname」，表示自己絕對不會忘記，並向你再次致謝。她祈禱未來某天還能再與你相見，說完便轉身離開。</p>
      <p>看著 Edda 的背影消失在人群中，Momodi 長長吐了一口氣，說冒險者這行真的是又殘酷又傷人。她坦言，過去自己壓根不懂為什麼會有人想走這條路，剛被邀請接下 The Quicksand 冒險者公會的負責人時，她本來一心只想拒絕，覺得要照顧這群人只會讓自己添一肚子麻煩。結果，她最後還是違背直覺答應了這份工作，如今回頭看，她覺得自己做了正確的選擇。能夠參與這些冒險者的人生片段，對她來說是一種榮幸，而對於你，她更是有雙倍的感激之情。這時，你向她打聽 Scions of the Seventh Dawn 的事，Momodi 的表情立刻嚴肅起來，說看來那群人總算開始正式行動了。她說，Scions 不是普通人，他們做的事也不是普通的工作；她很清楚你的實力有多強，但就算是你，聽到他們平常面對的那些任務，也一定會有猶豫的時候。即便如此，如果你在了解這些之後仍然真心想加入並幫助他們，她就會在自己能力範圍內，把所知道的一切都告訴你。</p>
