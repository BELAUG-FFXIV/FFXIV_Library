      <p>At the Quicksand, you wait beside Momodi as she glances toward the entrance and remarks that the petitioner should be arriving any moment now. Right on cue, an elderly Lalafell staggers in from the blazing Ul’dahn sun, complaining that another second out there would have set him on fire before calling out for a tankard of ale. Momodi greets him as Papashan and, with a pleased smile, tells him his timing is excellent—the adventurer who will be handling his petition is already here. When he turns and recognizes you, his face lights up; it does his spirit good, he says, to know that you are the one coming to their aid. Looking you over with open approval, he calls you the much-lauded adventurer he has heard so much about, then introduces himself properly as Papashan, formerly of the Sultansworn, and thanks you with solemn sincerity for agreeing to lend your strength.</p>
      <p>When Momodi suggests that he explain the situation to you, Papashan readily agrees. The petition, he says, was submitted by an acquaintance of his at Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern, and concerns an unfortunate development at Copperbell Mines: giants have seized control of the place. These giants are of a clan known as the hecatoncheires—fearsome creatures who were sealed within the deepest depths of the mines in the days of the Thorne Dynasty. When Momodi comments that it is little wonder they are angry if that dynasty ended more than three hundred years ago, Papashan praises her sharp memory for history and continues. The people of that age, he explains, used the hecatoncheires as forced labor, binding the ferocious beings to their will with enchanted helms so they could work the mines. As so often happens in such tales, those enchantments eventually failed. Freed from their shackles, the slaves rose up against their masters, and in a desperate bid to contain their fury, your ancestors induced the collapse of the mines’ lowermost levels, burying the giants beneath a hundred thousand tonzes of rock and thus ending what came to be known as the Great Giant Revolt.</p>
      <p>You learn that the story did not end there. Recently, as demand for building materials rose, Copperbell Mines were reopened, a development even reported in the pages of the Mythril Eye. Likely digging a little too deep in their eagerness to extract ore, the miners broke through the ancient barrier that had imprisoned the hecatoncheires. Against all expectation, the giants had survived their long entombment; now they prowl the same tunnels where miners ply their trade, their anger at the injustices of the past stoked anew. Their presence has forced the suspension of all mining activities, and so long as they remain, there will be no work and no prosperity to be had there. For the sake of both peace and the nation’s recovery, Papashan says, the giants must be subdued, and this is the task he asks you to undertake. He does not deny that the mission is rife with danger, but their need is great, and so he humbly begs you to put an end to this sorry state of affairs. When you accept, he breathes a sigh of heartfelt relief and calls the blessing of the gods upon you, admitting he feared you might have reservations. Momodi then adds a practical reminder that Copperbell Mines are in western Thanalan and urges you to take care on the road. Before you depart, Papashan mentions one last detail: an employee of Amajina & Sons named Painted Mesa is currently at the Quicksand and knows Copperbell well. It would be wise, he suggests, to seek the man’s counsel before setting out.</p>
      <p>When you approach Painted Mesa, he sizes you up at a glance and confirms his own identity with a short nod, guessing correctly that you are the adventurer who volunteered to deal with the Copperbell situation. He remarks that you have guts and hopes your skills match your courage, because things are in a sorry state down there. The hecatoncheires have already left the place in ruins, and mining had resumed for barely a week when the trouble started. Copperbell, he explains, was already an old mine when the second Ul Dynasty was still young, and it was abandoned centuries ago. If not for the shortage of materials needed for Ul’dah’s rebuilding, the Concern would never have considered reopening it. They knew about the giants beforehand, but the project went ahead anyway, on the assumption that nothing could survive being buried under a mountain’s worth of rock for three hundred years. That assumption, as it turned out, was wrong.</p>
      <p>You hear how one swing of a pickaxe too many put the miners in the company of giants, and unless the hecatoncheires can be subdued, the nation’s glorious recovery will grind to a halt for want of materials. Painted Mesa tells you that the Stone Torches are keeping watch over the entrance to Copperbell Mines in western Thanalan, lest the giants decide to seek sunlight and fresh air. One of these watchmen will be able to show you the way in. The hope of the nation, he says, rests on your shoulders, and he wishes you the best of luck as you depart.</p>
      <p>Following his directions, you travel to western Thanalan and make your way to the landmark at Copperbell Mines. There you encounter fellow adventurers Alianne and Isildaure, who share grim news: they have found Dolorous Bear and his entire party dead, the giants having been thorough in their work. From the tracks, it seems the fallen crew tried to rush a horde of hecatoncheires, and though Alianne cannot say for certain what drove such experienced adventurers to abandon caution, she suspects a desire to outdo past achievements pushed them into reckless risk. She warns that when people fixate on their goals to the exclusion of all else, they can blind themselves to danger and pay the price, as Dolorous Bear and his comrades did. Isildaure reflects on his long years as an adventurer, saying that though times change, the essence of the trade does not: it has always been a quest for self-betterment through challenges freely faced. With experience comes a love of justice and an understanding of self-sacrifice, shaped not by some tally you can measure, but by the choices you have made and their consequences, good or ill. When he looks at you, he says he senses a light within you—a sign, he believes, that you are destined for greatness.</p>
      <p>When you approach the Stone Torches at the entrance, one of the guards warns you that there has been an incident inside Copperbell Mines and advises you, for your own safety, to stay away. When you explain that you are the adventurer who volunteered to quell the hecatoncheires, he is taken aback, admitting he did not think Papashan would be able to find someone so quickly, if at all. For now, he says, the giants seem content to wreak havoc inside the tunnels, but it is only a matter of time before they decide to come outside. The sooner you deal with them, the better. He urges you to make ready as best you can and enter when you are prepared. With that, the duty to clear Copperbell Mines is added to your options, and the guard offers one last wish of good fortune as you cross the threshold. While the Stone Torches maintain their vigil at the entrance, you press on into the dark, face the giants that have seized the mine, and at length emerge victorious, having brought the hecatoncheires to heel and made the tunnels safe once more.</p>
      <p>Returning to Ul’dah, you seek out Painted Mesa at the Quicksand. He greets you as the conqueror of Copperbell and thanks you profusely, declaring that, thanks to your efforts, mining operations can resume and Ul’dah will have the materials it needs to rebuild. The entire nation, he says, is in your debt. He promises to share the good tidings with Papashan the next time they meet, then advises you to report to Momodi, adding that it will do her heart good to see you alive and in one piece. Later, in the streets of the Steps of Nald, you hear an anguished shout and come upon an obnoxious merchant berating a frightened refugee woman. He accuses her of stealing a choice cut of dodo meat, calling refugees thieves who could not afford even rotten scraps. She tearfully insists she bought it with coin she saved herself and begs him to believe her. He threatens to hand her over to the Brass Blades or, if she wishes to avoid that fate, to make her serve him in whatever capacity he desires. Desperate, she turns to you and begs for your help, swearing that she only wanted to give her children a decent meal.</p>
      <p>You step in, and the merchant sneers, demanding to know who you think you are. He calls on his hirelings to teach you both a lesson, and one of his bodyguards staggers forward to take on the task, drunkenly boasting that he will handle it alone. In the brief clash that follows, he belches, curses, and calls for help even as he tries to make you bleed. In the end, he collapses, regretting that he did not stop at his seventh ale instead of pressing his luck. Another bodyguard decides he is not being paid enough for this and flees, ignoring the merchant’s outraged shouts as he demands to know where his men are going. With his enforcers scattered, the man finds the tables turned, while the woman thanks you over and over again for saving her from whatever might have followed.</p>
      <p>In that moment, your vision blurs, and the Echo carries your senses away to Central Thanalan, where you witness a scene at Spineless Basin. A young city-dweller remarks that there seem to be more refugees than before, and a concerned citizen confirms that he is not mistaken. In the years since the Calamity, he explains, some hamlets survived the immediate disaster but found their lands barren or cut off from trade routes; problems like those are not easily solved. Though people tried to make the best of it, many were eventually forced to abandon their homes and seek new lives in the cities. The young man asks if the same thing is happening elsewhere, and his companion says that, if the talk is true, it is, though Ul’dah’s reputation for prosperity makes it an especially tempting place for refugees to try their luck. The younger man’s heart goes out to them, yet he cannot help but feel apprehensive, fearing their presence might lead to lawlessness. The older citizen replies that, if things do take a turn for the worse, the Immortal Flames and the Brass Blades will be there to keep order—but he also points out that impoverished and desperate people are likely to turn to crime in a city where those without coin have no hope.</p>
      <p>As a sure-voiced salesman calls out about dodo tenderloins and thanks customers for their business, the young city-dweller observes that, at a glance, Ul’dah appears well on its way to recovery. But his companion warns that if you peer through the veil of prosperity, you see no end to the misery and suffering beneath. With those words, the Echo fades, and you find yourself back in the present, facing the refugee woman and the merchant in the streets of Ul’dah. She timidly asks if you are all right, while he recoils and accuses you of threatening a defenseless citizen. When you and others point out that people saw her buy the meat, voices from the crowd rise in her defense, calling him a vulture and telling him to leave her alone. The merchant demands to know who spoke, then curses under his breath and grudgingly declares that he will overlook the matter—just this once. After he slinks away, the woman thanks you again, saying that if you had not arrived when you did, she dreads to think what might have happened.</p>
      <p>Not long after, a familiar voice calls out that all is well that ends well, and you turn to see Thancred. He greets you with a roguish smile and says that you meet again, asking you not to mistake his intentions—however suspicious his timing might seem—for they are, he insists, always honorable. He admits that he has been watching you ever since you departed Ul’dah as an envoy, and praises the way you played the part: confident as a woman on a diplomatic mission should be, yet unfailingly courteous. When your travels led you into danger, he notes, you faced it without so much as a flinch. He confesses himself quite taken with you, particularly with your readiness to help those in need even when mere words were all the reward you could expect. Such selflessness, he says, is a rare thing in this age, and all of it leads him to believe that you are the very adventurer he has been searching for.</p>
      <p>Thancred goes on to say that he is also deeply interested in a certain talent of yours—your visions. You have been experiencing them, have you not? As it happens, he knows a woman who shares that gift and can help you understand it. She and Thancred belong to the same organization, and both would be delighted beyond words if you would agree to join their cause. There are benefits, he points out, to being part of such a collective; for one, they would gladly help you realize your full potential as an adventurer. You need not answer immediately, he says. Instead, he asks you to think on it, and if you feel moved to help them, as he hopes you will, you are to speak with Momodi, the ever-lovely and youthful mistress of the Quicksand. Tell her that the Scions of the Seventh Dawn have found their woman, and she will tell you where to find them.</p>
      <p>When you return to the Quicksand, Momodi remarks with a sigh that scenes like the one you just witnessed are becoming ever more common. She tells you not to worry too much—if you work hard, you will probably be all right—but adds that if you ever find yourself in real trouble, you should come and see her, so long as you do not pester her over every scraped knee. In the next breath, she admits that she does enjoy hearing a gentleman’s woes with the womenfolk from time to time. Then she turns her full attention to you, apologizing for keeping you waiting while she provided guidance to a fresh-off-the-carriage adventurer. It does her good, she says, to see you safe and sound; to look at you, no one would guess you had been battling giants in the dark. She never doubted for a moment that you would succeed, and neither did Papashan. You are, she declares, every ilm the adventurer Miounne said you would be, and the stationmaster will be overjoyed when he hears the news. Before she forgets, she mentions that there is a young woman who wants a word with you. The lass did not know your name, but from her description, Momodi knew immediately whom she meant.</p>
      <p>The girl introduces herself as Edda and thanks you shyly for sparing the time, admitting that you do not know her. She explains that she is an adventurer like you, though she feels she is not very good at it. She had been adventuring with her friends in Gridania when the leader of their party was killed. His name was Avere, she says, and they were to be wed in the spring. You may not remember him, but he remembered you all too well, praising you from dawn to dusk and calling you an adventurer’s adventurer, swearing that he would one day be like you. She believes he would have succeeded, had a fiend not robbed him of his chance. Since that day, she has thought long and hard about giving up adventuring altogether, yet when she thinks of the kind of adventurer you are and all you have achieved, she finds herself inspired, just as Avere once was.</p>
      <p>Edda tells you that she has decided to begin again. She will return to the village of her birth and start her training anew, but before she goes, she wanted to meet you—to look you in the eye and ask your name. You tell her, and she repeats it softly, saying she will not forget. She thanks you once more and expresses her hope that you will meet again someday, before taking her leave. After she departs, Momodi reflects that adventuring can be a cruel, bloody business, and that there was a time when she could not understand why anyone would choose such a life. When she was first asked to take charge of the guild, she wanted nothing to do with adventurers, thinking it would be a right pain looking after the lot of you. Against her better judgment, she accepted the post, and now, she says, she is glad she did, feeling privileged to be part of so many lives—especially yours. When you ask about the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, she realizes they are beginning to move in earnest. She warns you that they are no ordinary folk and that the work they do is no ordinary work. She knows how capable you are, but even you would think twice about attempting some of what they take on. If, knowing this, you are still certain that you want to get involved, she promises to tell you what she can, and you prepare yourself to hear more of the path that lies ahead.</p>

      <p>あなたは「クイックサンド」でモモディのそばに立ち、依頼人がそろそろ到着するはずだと彼女が入口を見やるのを見守っている。ほどなくして、ウルダハの容赦ない日差しから逃げるように、年配のララフェルが転がり込むように店へ駆け込んできた。もう一瞬外にいたら燃え上がっていたところだと大げさに嘆き、ビールを一杯頼むその男を、モモディは慣れた様子でパパシャーンと呼び、笑みを浮かべる。そして、ちょうどいいところに来たと告げる。彼が出した依頼を引き受けてくれた冒険者が、すでにここにいるのだと。あなたに視線を向けたパパシャーンは、すぐにあなたを認めて顔をほころばせる。あなたが助けに来てくれたと知り、心から元気づけられたと言い、噂に名高い冒険者がまさに目の前にいると感心したようにあなたを眺めると、自らをウルダハの近衛「サルタンズウォーン」に属していたパパシャーンだと改めて名乗り、力を貸してくれたことに、深々と頭を下げて礼を述べる。</p>
      <p>モモディに促され、パパシャーンは今回の事態について語り始める。今回の嘆願は、アマジナ鉱山社に勤める知人から出されたものであり、カッパーベル銅山で起きた由々しき問題に関するものだという。なんと、そこを「ヘカトンケイレス族」と呼ばれる巨人たちが占拠してしまったのだ。彼らは、ソーン朝の時代に、鉱山最深部へと封じ込められた恐るべき存在であった。ソーン朝が三百年以上も前に滅んだとすれば、巨人たちが怒りを募らせていても不思議ではないとモモディが口を挟むと、パパシャーンは彼女の歴史への造詣を褒め、説明を続ける。当時の人々は、魔法で付与された兜を用いてヘカトンケイレス族を意のままに操り、鉱山労働に従事させていた。しかし、そうした物語によくあるように、その魔法はやがて効果を失う。支配から解き放たれた奴隷たちは主人たちに反旗を翻し、激しい「巨人族反乱」が起きたのだ。暴走する怒りを抑え込むため、祖先たちは最後の手段としてカッパーベル銅山の最下層を崩落させ、巨人たちを十万トンズもの岩の下に埋めることで、この反乱を終わらせたのだと。</p>
      <p>だが、その物語はそれで終わりではなかった。近年、建材需要の高まりを受けてカッパーベル銅山の再開が決まり、「ミスリルアイ」の紙面でも取り上げられたほどである。ところが、鉱夫たちが掘り進めるうちに、かつて巨人たちを閉じ込めていた岩盤を打ち破ってしまったのだ。信じがたいことに、ヘカトンケイレス族は三百年もの時を経てもなお生き延びており、今や採掘場で働く鉱夫たちと同じ坑道を徘徊しているという。過去に受けた仕打ちへの怒りを再び燃え上がらせた彼らの存在により、鉱山での作業は全面的に中断され、平穏も繁栄も望めぬ状況となっていた。パパシャーンは、街の安全と復興のためにも、巨人たちを鎮めねばならないと告げ、それがあなたに頼みたい大仕事なのだと語る。この任務がいかに危険に満ちているかを彼は否定しない。それでもなお、差し迫った状況を前に、彼はどうかこの悲惨な事態に終止符を打ってほしいと、深く頭を下げて懇願する。あなたがその依頼を受けると、彼は安堵の息を漏らし、迷いがあるのではないかと案じていた己の心を恥じつつ、十二神の加護があらんことをと祈りを捧げる。モモディは、西ザナラーンにあるカッパーベル銅山までの道のりを気遣って注意を促し、最後にパパシャーンは、鉱山社の社員ペインテッド・メサという男が今ここ「クイックサンド」にいることを教えてくれる。カッパーベルに詳しい彼から話を聞いていくといいと勧められ、あなたは準備を整えて声をかけに向かう。</p>
      <p>あなたがペインテッド・メサに近づくと、彼は軽く顎をしゃくって自分がそうだと名乗り、すぐにあなたがカッパーベルの厄介事を買って出た冒険者だと見抜く。度胸はありそうだが、腕前もそれに見合っていてくれると助かる、と冗談めかしつつも真剣な口調で言い添え、状況がいかにひどいかを説明し始める。ヘカトンケイレス族が、再開から一週間も経たないうちに坑内をめちゃくちゃにしてしまったのだという。カッパーベル銅山は第二ウル朝がまだ若かった頃にはすでに古びた坑道であり、何世紀も前に放棄されていた。ウルダハ復興のための建材不足がなければ、アマジナ鉱山社が再開など考えることもなかった場所だ。巨人の存在は最初から承知していたが、山ひとつ分の岩の下で三百年も眠っていれば、生きていられるはずがないと踏んでいた。しかし、その読みは見事に外れたのである。</p>
      <p>鉱夫たちがツルハシを振るい続けた末、気づけば巨人たちと同じ空間に立っていた──そうして、ヘカトンケイレス族との新たな対峙が始まったのだ。彼らを鎮圧できなければ、ウルダハの華々しい復興は、建材不足によってたちまち頓挫してしまうだろう。ペインテッド・メサは、西ザナラーンのカッパーベル銅山入口には「ストーン・トーチ」と呼ばれる警備兵たちが詰めており、巨人たちが陽の光と新鮮な空気を求めて地上へ出てこないよう見張りを続けているのだと説明する。そのうちのひとりが、坑道への道を案内してくれるはずだ。彼は、国の未来があなたの肩にかかっていると告げ、幸運を祈りながらあなたを送り出す。</p>
      <p>あなたは教えられたとおり西ザナラーンへと向かい、ランドマークとなっているカッパーベル銅山の前に辿り着く。そこで、同じ冒険者であるアリアンヌとイサディオルに出会い、耳を傾けることになる。彼女らは、先行していたドルロス・ベア一行の遺体を発見したばかりだと語り、その無残な最期が巨人たちの容赦ない暴力を物語っていると伝える。足跡から判断するに、彼らは多数のヘカトンケイレス族に突撃を試みたらしい。なぜ経験豊富な一団が、あのような無謀な行動に出てしまったのかは断定できないが、アリアンヌは、過去の成果を越えようとするあまり、分別を失ってしまったのだろうと推測する。目標を持つことは大事だが、それ以外のものが見えなくなれば、やがては高くつく代償を払うことになる──そうしてドルロス・ベアたちもまた命を落としたのだと。</p>
      <p>長年冒険者として生きてきたイサディオルは、歴史の節目となる出来事を幾度も見届けてきたと振り返りながらも、時代が移ろおうとも冒険という営みの本質は変わらないと語る。冒険とは、自ら選び取った試練を通じて己を鍛え、成長していくことだ。経験を重ねるうちに、やがて正義を愛する心と自己犠牲の精神が育まれていく。それは数字で測れるようなものではなく、旅の途上で下してきた一つひとつの決断と、その結果──善きにつけ悪しきにつけ──によって形作られていくものだという。そしてイサディオルは、あなたを見つめながら、その胸の内に確かな光を感じると言う。それは、将来大いなる存在となる者に宿る輝きだと信じているのだと、穏やかな笑みとともに告げる。</p>
      <p>やがて、あなたは坑道入口に立つストーン・トーチの兵に声をかける。彼は、カッパーベル銅山内部で事件が発生しており、その影響が外へ広がらないよう警戒中だと説明し、身の安全のためにも近づかないほうがいいと忠告する。しかし、あなたがヘカトンケイレス族鎮圧の志願者であることを告げると、彼は驚きの声を上げる。パパシャーンがこうも早く、いや、そもそも誰かを見つけられるとは思っていなかったのだという。今のところ巨人たちは坑道内で暴れ回るだけで満足しているようだが、このまま黙って地上に出てこない保証はない。だからこそ、一刻も早く対処する必要があるのだと、彼は真剣な表情で告げる。できるかぎり準備を整えたうえで、覚悟ができたらいつでも中へ入ってくれ──そう言って、カッパーベル銅山の攻略任務があなたの選択肢に加えられる。兵士は最後に、十二神の加護を願う言葉をかけ、あなたはストーン・トーチたちが見守る中、暗き坑道へと足を踏み入れていく。そこでは、鉱山を支配した巨人たちとの戦いが待ち受けており、あなたは奮戦の末、ついにヘカトンケイレス族を鎮圧して坑道を安全な場所へと戻すのだった。</p>
      <p>ウルダハへ戻ったあなたは、再びクイックサンドでペインテッド・メサを訪ねる。彼は、カッパーベルの征服者とあなたを称え、心からの感謝を述べる。あなたのおかげで採掘作業を再開でき、ウルダハは復興に必要な資材を手に入れられる。国中があなたに恩義を感じているとまで言ってのけ、次にパパシャーンに会ったときは、必ずこの吉報を伝えると約束する。そしてあなたには、モモディに報告しておくといい、元気な姿を見れば彼女もきっと喜ぶだろうと付け加える。その後、ナル回廊の通りを歩いていると、甲高い叫び声が耳に飛び込んでくる。声のするほうへ向かうと、一人の商人が怯えた様子の女性を怒鳴りつけていた。彼は、女が上等なドードー肉を盗んだと決めつけ、ロクでもない難民どもは盗みでもしないかぎり、腐った肉すら買えないだろうと罵声を浴びせる。女性は、貯めたお金でちゃんと買ったのだと必死に訴え、どうか信じてほしいと懇願する。</p>
      <p>商人は、正直に盗みを認めて盗品を返さなければ、ブラスブレードに突き出してやると脅し、街の治安のためだと嘯く。だが、もし当局の耳に入れられたくないのなら、自分の言うことを何でも聞く奉仕者として働けと、いやらしい取引を持ちかけるのだった。女性は震えながらも、あなたに助けを求める視線を向ける。子どもたちにたまにはまともな食事を食べさせてやりたかっただけだと涙ながらに訴え、冤罪を晴らしてほしいと懇願する。あなたが介入すると、商人はあざ笑うようにあなたを見下ろし、おまえはいったい何者だと吐き捨てる。そして、護衛たちに命じて二人まとめて痛い目を見せてやれと怒鳴る。酒臭い護衛の一人が前に出て、残りは見ていればいいと豪語しながらあなたに襲いかかるが、戦いの最中に悪態をつき、手を貸せと叫び、最後には酒を七杯でやめておくべきだったと後悔の言葉を漏らしながら倒れ伏す。もう一人の護衛は、こんな金でやっていられるかとばかりに逃げ出し、どこへ行くつもりだと商人が怒鳴っても振り返ろうともしない。こうして取り巻きたちは散り散りとなり、形勢は逆転する。女性は、もしあなたが来てくれなかったらどうなっていたか考えるだけで恐ろしいと、何度も感謝の言葉を口にする。</p>
      <p>その瞬間、あなたの視界がかすみ、エーテルが共鳴するような感覚が訪れる。「エコー」によって、あなたの意識は中央ザナラーンの「スピノレス盆地」へと引き寄せられていく。そこでは、一人の若い街人が、以前見たときより難民が増えているように思えると漏らし、隣に立つ市民がそれに同意していた。大災厄から五年も経つのに、なぜ今になってこんなに多くの人々が押し寄せているのかと問う若者に、年長の市民は静かに答える。大災厄直後はなんとか生き延びた集落も多かったが、やがて土地はやせ細り、交易路は寸断され、そうした問題は簡単には解決できない。人々は最善を尽くそうとしたものの、ついには故郷を捨て、街に新たな生活を求めざるを得なくなったのだと。</p>
      <p>若者が、他の都市でも同じようなことが起きているのかと尋ねると、噂が本当ならばそうだろうと市民は頷く。ただし、ウルダハは繁栄の都として知られているぶん、難民たちがまず頼ろうとするのはここになるのだろうとも付け加える。若者は、彼らに同情する気持ちは本物だとしながらも、不安を覚えずにはいられないと吐露し、街の治安が乱れないか心配だと本音を漏らす。市民は、もし事態が悪化するようなら、不滅隊やブラスブレードが立ち上がるはずだと答えつつ、貧しく追い詰められた人々の中には、犯罪に手を染める者も必ず出てくるだろうと警告する。この街では、金がなければ希望もないのだ、と。</p>
      <p>そのすぐそばでは、行商人がドードー肉のテンダーロインを売り歩き、「ザナラーン一お安いよ！」と威勢のいい声を上げている。若者は、その様子だけ見ればウルダハは順調に復興しているように見えると言うが、市民は、その繁栄の仮面の裏に目を凝らせば、終わりの見えない苦しみと悲嘆が広がっているのが見えるだろうと静かに告げる。その言葉とともに光景は薄れ、「エコー」は収束し、あなたは再びナル回廊の現実へと引き戻される。難民の女性は、おそるおそるあなたの様子をうかがい、大丈夫かと声をかける。一方の商人は、今度は自分が被害者であるかのように、無実の市民を脅すつもりかとあなたを非難する。しかし、あなたや周囲の人々が、彼女が代金を払っていたのを見ていたと告げると、人混みの中からも非難の声が上がり、あの女を放っておけと商人を「ハゲタカ」呼ばわりする。誰だ、と商人は怒鳴るが、やがて舌打ちをして、この件は見逃してやる、ただし今回だけだと捨て台詞を残し、悔しそうに去っていく。女性は、あなたが来てくれなければどうなっていたか考えるだけで身がすくむと語り、改めて深くあなたに感謝する。</p>
      <p>やがて、「終わりよければすべてよし」と軽妙な声が響き、あなたが振り向くと、サンクレッドが立っている。再会を喜ぶ彼は、いかにも胡散臭いタイミングだが、意図は常に高潔なものだと言い訳めいた冗談を飛ばしつつ、実はあなたがウルダハを発ってからずっと、その行く先を見守っていたのだと明かす。特使として各地を回るあなたの姿は、任務に臨む女性としての自信に満ちつつも、上に立つ者たちに対して礼節を失わないものだったと評価し、道中で危険の中に身を置いたときも一切ひるまなかったと称賛する。そして、困っている人々に対し、見返りが言葉だけだとしても手を差し伸べるその姿勢に、彼は何よりも心を打たれたのだと言う。そんな利他的な振る舞いは、この時代ではそう多く見られるものではないと。</p>
      <p>サンクレッドは、そのすべてを踏まえたうえで、あなたこそが自分が探し求めていた冒険者に違いないと感じていると告げる。さらに、彼が強い関心を抱いているあなたの能力についても言及する──そう、「幻視」の力だ。あなたはこれまでに何度も不思議な光景を見てきたはずだと指摘し、その才能を分かち合う知人の女性がいることを打ち明ける。彼女とサンクレッドは同じ組織「暁の血盟」に属しており、その力を理解し導くことができるのだという。そして、もしあなたが彼らの大義に加わることを選ぶなら、言葉にできないほど嬉しく思うだろうと誘いかける。そのような仲間たちと共に歩むことには、あなた自身の冒険者としての可能性を最大限に引き出す手助けを得られるという利点もある。</p>
      <p>もちろん、今すぐ答えを出す必要はないとサンクレッドは言う。よく考え、それでも彼らの力になりたいと思うなら──そう願っていると彼は付け加える──クイックサンドの若く麗しい女将モモディに話を持ちかけてほしい。「暁の血盟が求めていた人物を見つけた」と伝えれば、彼らの拠点への道を教えてくれるだろうと告げ、サンクレッドはあなたに決断を委ねるのだった。</p>
      <p>あなたが再びクイックサンドに戻ると、モモディは先ほどの騒動のような光景が最近ますます増えているのだと、ため息まじりに漏らす。もっとも、しっかり働いていれば、あなた自身はきっと大丈夫だろうと励ましつつ、もし本当に困ったことがあればいつでも相談においでと言ってくれる。ただし、ちょっと膝をすりむいたくらいで毎回駆け込んでこられては困ると、冗談めかして釘を刺すことも忘れない。とはいえ、ときどき男の恋愛の愚痴を聞くのは嫌いじゃないんだけどね、と茶目っ気のある笑みを添えるのだった。やがて彼女はあなたに向き直り、さきほど馬車から降りたばかりの新米冒険者にアドバイスをしていたせいで、待たせてしまって悪かったと詫びる。</p>
      <p>暗闇の中で巨人たちと渡り合ってきたとは思えないほど元気そうなあなたの様子に、モモディは心から安堵していると打ち明ける。あなたなら必ずやり遂げると一度たりとも疑ったことはなかったし、パパシャーンも同じ気持ちだっただろうと続ける。そして、あなたはミューヌが評したとおり、一イルムの狂いもなく立派な冒険者だと太鼓判を押し、この知らせを聞いた駅長もきっと大喜びするに違いないと笑う。ふと何かを思い出したように、彼女は、あなたに話があると訪ねてきた娘がいるのだと続ける。名前こそ知らなかったものの、その人となりの説明を聞いて、誰のことかすぐにわかったのだと。</p>
      <p>現れた娘はエッダと名乗り、見知らぬ自分のために時間を割いてくれたことに、少し震える声で礼を言う。自分もあなたと同じ冒険者だが、正直なところ、あまりうまくやれているとは言えないと打ち明ける。グリダニアで仲間たちと共に冒険をしていたとき、パーティのリーダーが戦いで命を落としてしまったのだという。その名はアヴェール──春には婚約者として自分と結ばれるはずだった人だと語る。あなたの記憶には残っていないかもしれないが、彼はあなたのことをよく覚えており、朝から晩まで賛辞を口にしていたとエッダは言う。あなたこそ「冒険者の中の冒険者」だと憧れ、いつか自分もあなたのようになりたいと誓っていたのだと。</p>
      <p>エッダは、もしあのまま生きていれば、彼はきっと夢を叶えていたに違いないと信じていると続ける。だが、ある魔物がその可能性を奪ってしまった。それ以来、彼女は冒険者をやめるべきか、何度も真剣に考えてきたという。けれども、あなたという人の歩みと成し遂げてきたことを思い返すとき、かつてアヴェールがそうであったように、自分もまた心を奮い立たせられるのだと打ち明ける。だからこそ、彼女はもう一度やり直す決意を固めたのだと言う。生まれ育った村へ戻り、一から鍛え直すつもりだと。</p>
      <p>それでも、その前にどうしてもあなたに会っておきたかったのだと、エッダは視線を上げる。あなたの目をまっすぐに見つめ、名前を教えてほしいと頼む。あなたが名乗ると、彼女はその名を小さく繰り返し、決して忘れないと心に刻むように語る。そして改めて礼を述べ、いつかまたどこかで会えることを願っていると告げて去っていく。エッダの背中を見送ったあと、モモディは、冒険者稼業というものがいかに残酷で血生臭い仕事になり得るかを改めて実感していると漏らす。かつては、なぜわざわざそんな道を選ぶのか理解できず、ギルドの責任者を任されそうになったときも、こんな連中の面倒を見るなんて真っ平御免だと思っていたのだと苦笑する。</p>
      <p>それでも結局、彼女はその役目を引き受け、今では心から引き受けてよかったと思っていると語る。冒険者たちの人生の一部に関わることができるのは、むしろ光栄なことだと感じているのだと。そして、それはあなたに対してはなおさらだと、モモディは穏やかな笑みで付け加える。やがてあなたが「暁の血盟」について尋ねると、彼女は、とうとう本格的に動き始めたようだと表情を引き締める。暁の面々は普通の人間ではないし、彼らの仕事もまた普通ではない。あなたがどれほど有能であろうと、彼らが手がける事柄の中には、さすがに二の足を踏みたくなるようなものもあるだろうと率直に告げる。それでもなお、その覚悟を持って関わりたいのだと言うのなら、自分にできる範囲で知っていることを話そう──そう言って、モモディはあなたの決意を静かに見つめ、あなたはこれから開かれる新たな道に思いを巡らせるのだった。</p>

      <p>你站在 The Quicksand 的吧檯前，聽著 Momodi 一邊瞄向門口，一邊說委託人差不多也該到了。話才剛落，一名年長的 Lalafell 就像是逃離 Ul’dah 毒辣陽光般衝進店裡，一面抱怨再多待一秒整個人就要被烤焦，一面大聲點了一杯啤酒。Momodi 熟門熟路地喊他 Papashan，笑著說他的 timing 真好，負責這次委託的冒險者已經在這裡了。Papashan 轉頭看到你，立刻露出明顯的喜色──得知會來幫忙的人是你，讓他打從心底覺得安心。他仔細打量你，說傳聞中那位備受稱讚的冒險者果然名不虛傳，接著正式自我介紹自己曾是 Sultansworn 的一員，現在只是個站務長，並非常鄭重地向你致謝，感激你願意伸出援手。</p>
      <p>在 Momodi 的提示下，Papashan 開始向你說明任務的來龍去脈。這次的請願，是出自他在 Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern 任職的一位熟人，內容則關係到 Copperbell Mines 發生的嚴重事件──那裡已經被巨人佔領了。這些巨人屬於 hecatoncheires 族，是在過去 Thorne Dynasty 時代被封印在礦山最深處的可怕怪物。Momodi 插嘴說，如果那個王朝在三百多年前就已經滅亡，那這些巨人會憤怒也不奇怪；Papashan 稱讚她歷史學得很好，接著補充細節。當年的人們，利用附有魔法的頭盔強行控制 hecatoncheires 族，逼迫他們在礦坑裡勞動。然而，正如這種故事常見的發展，那些魔法終有失效的一日。一旦失去束縛，被奴役的巨人便向主人反叛，掀起了激烈的「巨人起義」。為了遏止那股無法收拾的怒火，先民們選擇讓礦山最底層崩塌，用數以十萬計 tonze 的岩石將巨人永遠埋葬，藉此終結這場被後世稱為 Great Giant Revolt 的動亂。</p>
      <p>然而，故事並沒有就此劃下句點。近年來，隨著重建工程對建材需求的上升，Copperbell Mines 被重新啟用，甚至還登上了 Mythril Eye 的報導。礦工們一邊為了開採新的礦脈而不斷向地下深處挖掘，一邊恐怕也沒想到自己鑿穿的是封印巨人的那層岩壁。出乎所有人預料，hecatoncheires 族在被埋藏三百年後竟然還活著，如今他們就在礦工原本作業的坑道裡徘徊，把過去所受的屈辱與憤怒重新點燃。因為這些巨人的存在，整座礦山被迫全面停工，只要他們還在，和平與繁榮就無從談起。Papashan 告訴你，為了城市的安全與國家的復興，必須想辦法鎮壓這些巨人，而這正是他希望你接下的任務。他毫不掩飾這趟行動危機四伏，但眼前的情勢十分嚴峻，只能懇切地請求你替這場悲劇畫下句點。當你答應的那一刻，他真正鬆了一口氣，坦言自己原本還擔心你會有所顧慮，隨即衷心為你祈求眾神庇佑。Momodi 這時補充提醒 Copperbell Mines 位在 western Thanalan，要你路上多加小心。臨行前，Papashan 還特別提到一件事：Amajina & Sons 有位員工叫 Painted Mesa，現在就在 The Quicksand，他對 Copperbell 相當熟悉，建議你出發前先去和他聊聊。</p>
      <p>你走向 Painted Mesa 時，他抬頭打量你一下，先是說自己就是你在找的那個人，接著立刻猜出你就是那位自願處理 Copperbell 問題的冒險者。他說你膽子不小，希望你的本事也能跟那份勇氣相配，因為礦坑裡的情況一點都不好看。hecatoncheires 族短短不到一週，就把整個礦山弄得亂七八糟。Painted Mesa 解釋，Copperbell 在第二代 Ul Dynasty 還很年輕的時候就已經算是老礦坑了，幾個世紀前就被封閉，若不是因為重建工程需要大量建材，Amajina & Sons 根本不會考慮重新啟用。說到底，他們一開始就知道裡面曾經有巨人，只是誰也不相信有東西能在一整座山的岩石下存活三百年，於是工程還是照樣推進──而這個判斷，顯然錯得離譜。</p>
      <p>當礦工多揮了幾下鎬頭之後，才發現自己竟然與巨人比肩而立，這才真正意識到事情失控。若是無法鎮壓那些 hecatoncheires，Ul’dah 的華麗復興計畫就會因缺乏建材而被迫停擺。Painted Mesa 告訴你，現在由 Stone Torches 在 western Thanalan 的礦坑入口駐守，防止巨人跑到地面上來享受陽光與新鮮空氣。其中一位守衛會帶你進入 Copperbell Mines。最後，他說整個國家的希望都壓在你肩上，祝你一路順利，便讓你啟程。</p>
      <p>依照指示，你來到 western Thanalan 的 Copperbell Mines 地標附近。在那裡，你碰上了同樣在冒險的 Alianne 和 Isildaure，並聽他們提起剛剛發生的慘劇：他們找到 Dolorous Bear 一行人時，對方已經全員身亡，死狀十分淒慘，看得出巨人下手毫不留情。從腳印和痕跡來看，那一隊人似乎是選擇衝向成群的 hecatoncheires，試圖硬碰硬地突破。Alianne 說，她無法斷言為何那群經驗老到的冒險者會把謹慎丟到一邊，但她懷疑，或許是想超越過去的戰績、證明自己比從前更強，反而讓他們失去冷靜。人往往最嚴苛的批評者是自己，一旦只剩下執著於目標，忽略了其他一切，最後付出的代價就會像今天這樣沉重。</p>
      <p>Isildaure 則從自己多年的冒險者生涯談起，說自己見證過許多足以寫進歷史的重要時刻，但不管時代怎麼變，冒險這件事本身的本質並沒有改變。冒險者追求的是透過自願面對挑戰來磨練自己、讓自己成長。隨著經驗累積，人自然會逐漸理解什麼是正義，也會懂得犧牲與奉獻的精神。這種經驗無法被什麼具體的數字量化，卻會深刻地形塑每一個人，因為那是一路走來每一次選擇，以及那些選擇帶來的好與壞共同堆疊出來的結果。Isildaure 說，當他看著你的時候，能感覺到你身上有一道光，那讓他相信你有成為非凡冒險者的潛質，未來必定會成就一番大事。</p>
      <p>之後，你來到由 Stone Torches 守衛的礦坑入口。其中一名守衛對你說，Copperbell Mines 裡發生了事故，他們正在確保事態不會蔓延，因此勸你為了自身安全最好離遠一點。但當你表明自己正是自願前來鎮壓 hecatoncheires 的冒險者時，他露出意外的神情，承認自己原本完全沒想到 Papashan 真的找得到人，更別說找得這麼快。現在巨人們暫時還滿足於在礦坑裡大肆破壞，不過遲早會想到走出來，跑到地面上。守衛說，愈早解決他們愈好，請你先做好準備，覺得時機成熟了就隨時可以進去。隨著他的話語，Duty Finder 裡出現了新的任務：Copperbell Mines 已可進入。他最後祝你武運昌隆，而你也在 Stone Torches 的注視下踏入黑暗的坑道，迎戰佔據礦山的巨人。經過一番苦戰，你成功完成任務，將 hecatoncheires 鎮壓，使礦坑恢復安全。</p>
      <p>回到 Ul’dah 後，你在 The Quicksand 再次找到 Painted Mesa。他用「征服 Copperbell 的英雄」來稱呼你，真心實意地向你道謝。多虧了你，礦坑得以重新開採，Ul’dah 也能取得重建所需的材料，他說整個國家都欠你一份人情。他會在下次見到 Papashan 時向他轉達這個好消息，而你則最好先去向 Momodi 報告，也讓她親眼看到你安然無恙。之後，在 Ul’dah - Steps of Nald 的街道上，你突然聽見一聲淒厲的慘叫，循聲走去，發現一名態度囂張的商人正在對著一位難民女子咆哮。他指控她偷了一塊上好的 dodo 肉，一邊辱罵難民連長滿蛆的肉都買不起，更別提這種上等貨色。女子則哭著辯解，說自己是用辛苦存下來的錢買的，請他不要冤枉自己。</p>
      <p>商人威脅說，理論上自己應該把她交給 Brass Blades，好讓這座城市的守法市民免於盜賊之害。不過，他自稱是個「講理」的人，只要她願意以「任何他要求的形式」為他效勞，就可以不用把這件事報告給守衛。女子聽了害怕得發抖，卻仍向你伸出求助的手，說自己真的什麼都沒偷，只是想讓孩子們難得吃頓像樣的飯菜。你站出來介入，商人冷眼打量你，口氣惡劣地問你到底算哪根蔥，接著叫來自己的打手，要他們教訓你們這些「不知天高地厚的人」。其中一名醉醺醺的保鏢晃晃悠悠地走上前，說剩下的人只要看好戲就行，然後便向你發起攻擊。</p>
      <p>在短暫而激烈的戰鬥中，他時而打嗝，時而咒罵，嘴裡喊著要你流血，還不時對同伴大吼讓他們來幫忙。最後，他捂著身上的傷倒下，懊悔自己不該在第七杯酒時還繼續喝下去。另一名保鏢則連出手都不願意，直接扔下一句「這點酬勞不值得」就逃得無影無蹤，任憤怒的商人在背後大吼「你給我站住！」也毫不理會。失去了打手，商人一下子失去底氣，而那位女子則不斷向你道謝，說要是沒有你出現，接下來會發生什麼事情根本不敢想。</p>
      <p>就在這時，你的視線一陣扭曲，熟悉的 Echo 再度啟動，意識被拉往中央 Thanalan 的 Spineless Basin。你看見一名年輕的城市居民望著聚集在附近的難民，說感覺人似乎比上次看到的時候又多了。旁邊的市民回答說，他沒有看錯。Calamity 已經過去五年，但很多小村莊雖然在災後勉強生存下來，卻面臨土地貧瘠、交易路線中斷等難題，這種問題可不是短時間就能解決。居民們盡可能撐下去，然而支撐不住的那一刻終究還是會來臨，於是他們只好放棄故鄉，到城市裡尋找新生活。年輕人接著問，全境既然都受了災，其他城市是否也面臨同樣情形，對方則說，若傳聞屬實，的確如此。不過，Ul’dah 向來以繁榮著稱，因此難民們會先選擇到這裡碰碰運氣也就不足為奇。</p>
      <p>年輕人坦言自己真心同情這些人，卻也忍不住感到不安，擔心他們的存在會讓城市治安惡化。市民則說，如果情況真的變得糟糕，Immortal Flames 和 Brass Blades 應該會出面維持秩序；但他也指出，許多難民如今又窮又絕望，要是有人走上犯罪這條路，其實一點都不奇怪。在這座城市裡，沒有錢就沒有希望。就在一旁，一名叫賣小販高聲吆喝「Dodo tenderloins！Thanalan 最便宜！」，還笑著感謝客人的光顧。年輕人看著這景象，說如果只看表面，會以為 Ul’dah 已經走在復興的康莊大道上。然而那位市民提醒他，只要把視線穿過這層繁華的薄紗，就會看見底下堆積著無止境的痛苦與悲傷。隨著這句話落下，畫面逐漸淡去，Echo 結束，你再次回到 Ul’dah - Steps of Nald 的街道。</p>
      <p>那位難民女子小心翼翼地問你是否無恙，而商人則立刻變了臉，反過來指控你威脅一位「手無寸鐵的良民」。當你和旁觀者指出有人親眼看見她付錢購買肉品時，周圍也開始傳出聲音，斥責商人像禿鷲一樣欺負弱者，要他放過那位女人。商人惱火地追問是誰說的話，但最後也只能咬牙切齒，勉強說這次就算了，不過僅此一次，隨後悻悻然離去。女子再次對你表達感激，說若非你出手相助，她實在不敢想像後果會是什麼。</p>
      <p>不久之後，一道輕快的聲音說：「結果皆大歡喜就好。」你回頭一看，是 Thancred 站在那裡。他笑著說你們又見面了，先半開玩笑地請你不要誤會他的意圖──即便他出現的時間總是看起來可疑，他的心意卻一向光明正大。接著他承認，自從你離開 Ul’dah 擔任 envoy 之後，他就一直在暗中關注你的行動。他稱讚你扮演 envoy 的模樣十分到位：作為一名肩負外交任務的女性，你展現出了應有的自信，同時對身份地位較高的人也始終維持應有禮節。而在旅程中遇上危險時，你從不退縮，面對威脅也絲毫不見怯懦。</p>
      <p>Thancred 坦言自己相當欣賞你，特別是你願意幫助那些需要幫助的人，即使能得到的回報只是幾句感謝之詞。這種願意無私伸出援手的態度，在這個時代並不多見。綜合一路上所見所聞，他得出結論：你正是他一直在尋找的那種冒險者。隨後，他提到自己對你某項能力有著強烈興趣──那就是你的異象之力。你過去幾次看到的那些令人困惑的畫面，其實都是同樣的力量在發揮作用。他說自己認識一位擁有相同天賦的女性，她能幫助你理解這股力量的本質。她和 Thancred 皆屬於同一個組織，如果你願意加入他們的行列，兩人都會感到無比欣喜。</p>
      <p>加入這樣的組織，當然也有實際的好處。Thancred 表示，他們會全力協助你開發作為冒險者的潛力，讓你走得更遠。他強調，你現在不需要立刻給出答案，只要好好思考即可。如果哪一天你覺得自己想要為他們出一份力──他說自己衷心希望這一天會到來──那就去找 The Quicksand 那位永遠年輕、永遠迷人的老闆娘 Momodi。只要跟她說「Scions of the Seventh Dawn 已經找到他們要找的人」，她就會告訴你該去哪裡找他們。</p>
      <p>你再次回到 The Quicksand，Momodi 一邊嘆氣一邊說，像剛才那樣的場面最近越來越常見。她叫你不用太擔心，只要好好努力，應該還是能安然度日。不過，如果哪天真的遇到什麼麻煩，隨時可以來找她，只是別因為每次擦傷膝蓋就跑來哀嚎。她還打趣說，偶爾聽聽男士們在戀愛上的困擾，她倒是很樂意。說完，她把話題拉回你身上，先為讓你久等而道歉，因為剛才她在替剛下馬車的新手冒險者指點迷津。</p>
      <p>看著你平安站在自己面前，完全看不出剛剛才在黑暗礦坑裡和巨人纏鬥過的模樣，Momodi 顯得格外放心。她說，自己從來沒有懷疑過你一定能成功，Papashan 想必也一樣。你完完整整就是 Miounne 所說的那種冒險者，每一寸都符合她的評價。想到站務長聽到這個消息時應該會有多高興，她也忍不住笑出聲來。接著，她想起還有別的事情要說，於是提到有個女孩特地來找你談話。對方其實不知道你的名字，但從描述看來，她立刻就知道要找的人是誰。</p>
      <p>那位女孩走上前，自稱叫 Edda。她有些緊張地感謝你願意抽空，承認你並不認識她。她說自己也是像你一樣的冒險者，只是老實說，並不太擅長當冒險者。她和朋友們曾在 Gridania 一起冒險，但某次任務中，他們隊伍的領隊不幸戰死。那人名叫 Avere，本來預定在春天與她結婚。你或許不記得他，但他卻對你印象深刻，經常從早到晚唱你的讚歌。Edda 說，在他眼中，你就是「冒險者中的冒險者」，他常說自己總有一天也要變得跟你一樣厲害。</p>
      <p>她相信，如果不是有怪物奪走了他的性命，他一定能實現這個願望。自那之後，她無數次想要乾脆放棄當冒險者，因為失去 Avere 讓她懷疑自己是否適合走上這條路。然而，每當她想到你這樣的冒險者，想到你一路走來的成就，就會像當初的 Avere 一樣被鼓舞，感覺自己仍然可以再試一次。於是她終於做出決定：要回到自己出生的村莊，重新開始訓練，從頭學起。</p>
      <p>不過，在離開之前，她希望能先親眼見到你，並親口詢問你的名字。你把自己的名字告訴她，她便輕聲重複了一遍，說自己絕對不會忘記。她再次向你道謝，祈禱未來某一天能再與你重逢，然後轉身離開。Edda 的身影消失後，Momodi 感嘆，冒險者的生活有時候真的是殘酷又血腥，她早年根本不懂為什麼有人會刻意選擇這樣的人生。當初有人請她擔任這間公會的負責人時，她一開始其實一點也不想答應，覺得要照顧這些冒險者肯定會很麻煩。</p>
      <p>但是最後她還是接下了這個職務，而現在回頭看，她真心覺得當初的選擇是對的。能夠參與每一位冒險者的人生，是種榮幸；對你而言，這份感覺更是加倍。說到這裡，她看著你，笑說自己能成為你旅程的一小部分，真的覺得很幸福。當你開口詢問關於 Scions of the Seventh Dawn 的事情時，Momodi 便察覺到，那群人似乎終於開始認真行動了。她提醒你，那些人不是普通人，他們做的事也絕非普通工作。就算她非常清楚你的能力有多強，仍然覺得有些事情就連你也會再三猶豫。儘管如此，如果你在了解這一切之後仍堅定地想要介入，那麼她會在自己所知的範圍內把能說的都告訴你。你在她的目光中整理心情，準備迎向接下來等待你的新道路。</p>
