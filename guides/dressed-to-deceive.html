    story:`<div class="clamp" data-collapsed="true">
      <p>At Camp Drybone, you report back to Isembard, who can only shake his head. He has seen no unusual activity, and none of the people under his care have given him any reason to doubt them. Even so, he knows that unless the culprit behind the disappearances is unmasked soon, more innocent lives will be lost. Before the weight of that thought can settle too heavily, Thancred speaks up with a new idea. Their suspect has been posing as a priest, using leaflets filled with false promises to lure the poor; if that is the bait, then the two of you must become the prey. Let the two of you pose as destitute souls in need of succor, he suggests, and see if the false priest comes to you. The plan sparks a glimmer of hope in Isembard’s eyes. He admits he is nearly useless in a fight, but he can at least provide the disguises. From his stores he produces a set of old tunics and slops, stained and foul-smelling, and offers them to you and Thancred. They will serve well enough, so long as you can stomach the odor. Thancred accepts them with thanks, then turns to you and explains the rest of the ruse: you must put on the rags and beg for work around the camp until word spreads that needy vagrants have arrived. In time, the false priest should hear of you and seek you out.</p>
      <p>You don the threadbare garments and set about your unpleasant task. Where once you might have been greeted as an adventurer, you now approach each person as a stranger in filthy clothes, asking after work or coin. Knerl eyes you warily before dismissing you as just another refugee and warning that the Immortal Flames have neither employment nor gil for the likes of you. Swaenhylt, preaching Azeyma’s teachings, turns his lofty words toward you, bidding a “needy child” open their heart to the sun goddess’s light and promising that, under Her gaze, you will want for nothing—yet no help comes beyond the sermon. Aurildis brushes you off with open irritation, insisting that being poor gives you no right to pester whomever you please and telling you to keep to “your own kind” out by the muddy pond near Drybone. Ermegarde greets you politely at first, only to falter when she takes in your appearance; their wares are far beyond your means, she says gently, and perhaps you should return to your fellows at the pond north of Sandgate. Even Adelstan, who is otherwise eager to feed hungry adventurers, has nothing to offer you in the way of work and impatiently sends you on your way so he can return to his story. One by one, you are turned aside, but in their rejections a pattern emerges: everyone seems to know of a gathering place for the poor by a pond on the outskirts.</p>
      <p>When you regroup with Thancred at Camp Drybone, he cannot help but tease you for your newfound talent in being a nuisance. The camp is abuzz with talk of newly arrived vagrants, he notes, which means your performance was convincing enough. Although the false priest has not yet taken the bait, the two of you have learned something important: the poor of the region have a makeshift commune by the pond north of Sandgate, a spot beyond the reach of the authorities and well suited for spiriting people away. Thancred proposes that you move your little act there and wait. You travel east toward Sandgate, where he is already in position. If you arrive in your usual adventurer’s garb, he chides you for forgetting the “lovely soiled garments” Isembard provided and reminds you that dressed as you are, any wary quarry would sense something amiss long before you could lay hands on him. Once properly disguised again, you stand beside him by the water’s edge. Thancred surveys you with a smirk and declares that you look positively dressed for deception. Now there is nothing left to do but wait for the kindly priest to appear and offer aid and comfort to the downtrodden.</p>
      <p>Before long, a robed figure approaches, his voice dripping with false pity as he calls out to you: poor, unfortunate souls, this is no way for men to live. He urges you to be at ease, assuring you that he means no harm. He claims to be a priest of the Order of Nald’thal, come to offer succor to those in need, and presses a familiar leaflet into your hands. The paper bears the supposed teachings of Nald, promising that if you trust in them, they will free you from the shackles of poverty and place the wealth of Nald into the hands of your children. It is the same kind of bait that has drawn so many from their homes. Thancred listens to the speech with thinly veiled disdain before declining, not because the offer fails to tempt, but because the performance is so atrocious. No true priest would sound like this, he says—and no true priest would write such drivel. With a sharp rebuke, he tears away the mask, calling the man by name: Ungust. The false priest recoils in shock, demanding to know how he was recognized, and then, realizing he has been tricked, begs you both not to hurt him. He protests that he was only doing what he did to protect his people.</p>
      <p>Under Thancred’s hard gaze, Ungust begins to talk. He explains that he is a man of the Golden Bazaar, raised there if not born. Some moons ago, Amalj’aa raiders started to descend upon the settlement, striking without warning like sandstorms and plundering at will. The defenders were too few to stand against them, and the people lived in constant terror. Wanting to save his home but knowing nothing beyond trade, Ungust did the only thing he could imagine a merchant doing: he approached the Amalj’aa to broker a deal. In exchange for sparing the Golden Bazaar, they made their demands—outrageous terms that grew worse with each breath. First, they wanted the schedule of crystal shipments leaving the Nanawa Mines, which Ungust obtained by bribing a worker to leak the information. Next, they demanded people. To meet that price, Ungust disguised himself as a priest, armed himself with leaflets filled with false promises, and preyed upon the vulnerable, delivering them into Amalj’aa hands. He claims he had no choice, that everything he did was for the sake of protecting his people.</p>
      <p>Thancred is unconvinced. Protecting one’s home is noble, he says, but not at the cost of innocents. Ungust could have gone to the Immortal Flames for aid; instead, he chose to sell out his own. Thancred suspects that the story is still incomplete and presses him, demanding to know what truly drove him to such depths. Ungust mumbles something under his breath, and when forced to repeat himself, finally spits out the truth: the coin was good. The Amalj’aa paid him more than he could ever earn selling mole meat for a hundred lifetimes. He sacrificed innocents simply to line his own pockets. Thancred’s contempt is absolute; words, he says, cannot express the disgust he feels. Even as Ungust tries to deflect blame onto you, onto the gods, onto anyone but himself, Thancred’s questioning continues. He demands to know whether Ungust was also responsible for leaking the Immortal Flames’ patrol routes to the enemy. Ungust denies it, swearing ignorance, but at this point Thancred is disinclined to believe anything that leaves the man’s mouth. It hardly matters for the moment. There will be time enough to drag the whole truth from him. What matters now is that the abductees are still out there somewhere. He resolves to wring every scrap of information from Ungust, and asks you to carry word of these developments to Minfilia.</p>
      <p>You leave Thancred with his prisoner and travel west to the Waking Sands in Western Thanalan, where Minfilia awaits in the Solar. She greets you warmly and notes with quiet satisfaction that you and Thancred seem to be working well together. When you relay all that has transpired—the false priest, Ungust’s betrayal, and the deal with the Amalj’aa—she listens intently and thanks you for uncovering the truth. As Thancred has said, the next step is to learn where the abducted have been taken, and only the Amalj’aa know that answer. Such knowledge will not be given freely. Minfilia fears that blood will be spilled before all is said and done, but if that is the price of rescuing the missing, then the Scions must be ready to pay it.</p>

      <p>キャンプ・ドライボーンに戻ったあなたは、まずイセムバードの報告を聞く。彼の目には、特に不審な動きは映っておらず、このキャンプの誰ひとりとして疑うべき者はいないという。それでも、犯人を突き止められないままでいれば、今後も罪なき人々が犠牲になり続けることは避けられない。重苦しい現実に押しつぶされそうになったそのとき、サンクレッドが口を開いた。偽の司祭は、誤った教えが書かれたビラをばらまき、貧しい者たちを甘言で誘い出している。それならば、こちらも同じ手を使って逆襲しようではないか──彼はそう提案する。つまり、あなたとサンクレッドが救いを求める浮浪者のふりをして、偽の司祭に目を付けさせるのだ。その策に、イセムバードの表情にわずかな希望の色が差す。自分は戦いの役には立たないが、変装用の服なら用意できると申し出て、物置から古びたチュニックとずた袋のようなズボンを取り出す。染みや汚れと臭いのきつささえ我慢できれば、浮浪者を装うにはうってつけだ。サンクレッドは礼を述べてそれを受け取り、あなたに作戦の詳細を説明する。イセムバードから借りたぼろ服に袖を通し、キャンプ内を回って仕事や金を恵んでほしいと頼み歩くのだ。野営地に新たな流れ者が現れたという噂が広まれば、やがて偽の司祭も耳にして近づいてくるに違いない。</p>
      <p>あなたは薄汚れた服に着替え、決して気持ちのよいとは言えない役回りをこなしていく。もともと冒険者として迎えられていたときとは違い、今のあなたは見るからにみすぼらしい身なりの流民にすぎない。クネルに声をかければ、最初こそ警戒しつつも冒険者への挨拶を口にするが、貧民のふりをして頼み込むと、すぐさま表情を曇らせて「不滅隊には、お前のような者にやる仕事も金もない」と冷たく追い払われる。アーゼマの教えを説くスウェーンヒルトは、太陽と探求の女神について高らかに語り、困窮した子らよ心を開けと説教を向けてくるが、与えられるのは言葉だけで、具体的な助けは何ひとつない。アウリルディスは、忙しいから他を当たれと迷惑そうに吐き捨て、貧しいからといって誰にでも絡んでよいわけではないとたしなめたうえで、ドライボーン近くの泥だらけの池のほとりで「同じ境遇の仲間」と固まっていろと言い放つ。エルメガルドは最初こそ礼儀正しく対応するが、あなたの姿を見て「うちの商品はとても高価で、とても手が出せないでしょう」と申し訳なさそうに告げ、サンドゲート北の池のそばにいる仲間のもとへ戻るよう勧める。腹を空かせた冒険者には喜んで食事を振る舞うアデルスタンでさえ、仕事を探しているというあなたに対しては、空きはないとそっけなく言い、さっさと立ち去るよう促した。誰に頼んでも門前払いだが、その拒絶の言葉の端々から、周囲の貧民たちがキャンプの外れ、特に池の周辺に集まって暮らしていることが分かってくる。</p>
      <p>やがてあなたが再びキャンプ・ドライボーンでサンクレッドと合流すると、彼は「厄介者を演じる腕前はなかなかのものだ」と皮肉混じりに称えた。野営地では新たな浮浪者の噂でもちきりになっているらしく、変装は十分に効力を発揮しているようだ。肝心の偽司祭こそ現れなかったものの、貧しい人々がサンドゲート北の池のほとりに集まり、当局の目も届かない場所で身を寄せ合っているという有力な情報を得ることができた。人目の少ないその場所なら、誰かをひそかに連れ去るには格好の条件が揃っている。そこでサンクレッドは、今度はその池のほとりに向かって芝居を続けようと提案する。あなたは東へ向かい、サンドゲート近くの池まで進む。そこで待っていたサンクレッドは、いつもの服装のまま現れたあなたを見ると、イセムバードから渡された「素敵な汚れた服」を着ていないことを指摘し、この格好では獲物に勘づかれてしまうと苦笑交じりにたしなめる。改めてぼろ服に袖を通し、ふたりで池のほとりに立つと、サンクレッドは満足げにあなたを眺め、「欺きの舞台にはうってつけの装いだ」と冗談めかして告げる。あとは、困窮者に救いの手を差し伸べに来る「親切な司祭」が姿を現すのを待つばかりだ。</p>
      <p>ほどなくして、ローブをまとった男が近づき、哀れみをたたえた声であなたたちに語りかけてくる。「なんと惨めな暮らしぶりか。人として、こんな生き方はあってはならない」と、まるで同情するふりをしながら。身構えるサンクレッドに対して、男は自分はナルザル教団の司祭であり、救いを与えるためにここへ来たのだと名乗る。そして、例のビラを差し出し、そこに記されたナルドの教えに従えば、貧困という枷から解き放たれ、ナールドの富が子らの手に授けられるのだと甘言を弄する。まさに、これまで多くの人々を家から連れ出してきた餌と同じ文句だ。サンクレッドは、その芝居がかった口調を最後まで聞き終えると、「実に魅力的な誘いではあるが……演技がひどすぎて、とても乗る気にはなれないな」と冷ややかに言い放つ。こんな台詞を吐く本物の司祭などいるはずがない──そう言って男の仮面を剥ぎ取り、その名を呼ぶ。「ウングスト」。正体を見破られた男は飛び上がるように驚き、なぜ自分だと分かったのかとわめきながら、騙されたことに気づいて命乞いを始める。自分は皆を守るためにやむを得ずやっただけだと必死に訴えるが、サンクレッドの鋭い視線はそれを許さない。</p>
      <p>観念したウングストは、しぶしぶ口を開く。自分はゴールデンバザーの出であり、少なくともそこで育った男だという。数か月前からアマルジャ族の襲撃が始まり、砂嵐のように突然現れては、好き放題に略奪と暴行を繰り返した。防衛に当たる者たちはあまりにも少なく、とても太刀打ちできず、住民たちは常に恐怖に怯えて暮らすほかなかった。故郷を救いたいと願いつつも、自分にできるのは商売だけ。そこで彼は、商人として唯一できることだと信じてアマルジャ族に接触し、取引を持ちかけたのだという。ゴールデンバザーを襲わない代わりに、彼らはいくつかの見返りを要求してきた。最初の条件は、ナナワ銀山から出るクリスタル出荷のスケジュールを渡すこと。それを知るために、ウングストは鉱山で働く者を金で買収し、情報を漏らさせた。次に求められたのは「人間」だった。そこで彼は司祭のふりをして偽りの教えを説くことを思いつき、甘い約束が書かれたビラで弱き者たちを誘い出しては、アマルジャ族のもとへ引き渡していたのだ。すべては故郷を守るためであり、自分には他に選択肢がなかったのだと、彼は繰り返し弁解する。</p>
      <p>しかし、サンクレッドは納得しない。故郷を守ることそれ自体は尊いが、その代償として無辜の人々を犠牲にするのは断じて許されない。ウングストには、不滅隊に助けを求めるという道もあったはずだ。それをせず、同胞を売り渡す道を選んだ理由は他にあると睨んだサンクレッドは、なおも問い詰める。何がきっかけで、そこまで堕ちたのか、と。ウングストは口ごもりながら何かを呟き、言い直すよう迫られると、ようやく本音を吐き出す。「払われるコインが、あまりにも良かったのだ」と。モグラ肉を何十年売り続けても決して手にできないほどの大金を、アマルジャ族はたやすく投げ与えたのだと誇らしげにさえ語る。つまり彼は、己の懐を潤すためだけに、無辜の者たちを犠牲にしたのである。サンクレッドは「お前に向ける軽蔑の念を言葉で表すことはできない」と吐き捨てるように言い放つ。なおもウングストは、世界がこんな有様なのは神々や冒険者たちのせいだと責任転嫁し、泣き叫びながら罪から逃れようとするが、サンクレッドは取り合わない。さらに彼は、最近漏洩していた不滅隊の哨戒ルートについてもウングストが関わっているのではないかと問いただす。男は必死に否定し、何も知らないと誓うが、もはやその口から出る言葉を信じる気にはなれない。とはいえ、今はそれを白黒つける段階ではない。真実を吐かせる時間はいくらでもある。何よりも優先すべきは、どこかに囚われている誘拐被害者たちの救出だ。サンクレッドは、目の前の男から搾り取れるだけの情報を搾り取るとあなたに約束し、その間に今回得られた事実をミンフィリアに伝えてほしいと頼む。</p>
      <p>あなたはサンクレッドと捕らえたウングストをその場に残し、西ザナラーンの「砂の家」へ向かう。ソーラーで待つミンフィリアは、あなたを温かく出迎え、サンクレッドともうまくやっているようだと嬉しそうに微笑む。あなたが偽司祭の正体とウングストの裏切り、そしてアマルジャ族との取引の顛末を順を追って報告すると、彼女は真剣な面持ちで耳を傾け、真実を暴いてくれたことに深く感謝する。サンクレッドが言っていたように、次に為すべきは誘拐された人々がどこへ連れて行かれたのかを突き止めることだが、その答えを知るのはアマルジャ族だけだろう。その情報を、穏便な手段で引き出せるとはとても思えない。事態が決着するまでのあいだに血が流れることは避けられないかもしれない──そう懸念しながらも、ミンフィリアは、行方不明者たちを救うためなら、暁がその覚悟を持たねばならないと静かに言葉を結ぶのだった。</p>

      <p>在 Camp Drybone，你先向 Isembard 說明目前的情況，他只能無奈地搖頭。到目前為止，他既沒有發現任何可疑的動靜，也沒有看見營地裡的誰有值得懷疑的舉止。然而，只要犯人一天沒有現形，就有可能再有無辜者落入魔爪，這一點讓他備感壓力。正當氣氛逐漸沉重時，Thancred 突然提出一個新主意。既然嫌犯會偽裝成 priest，利用充滿虛假承諾的 leaflet 引誘窮人，那麼你們就以其人之道還治其人之身──由你和他來裝成需要救濟的貧民，反過來吸引對方上鉤。這個提議讓 Isembard 的眼中浮現一絲希望。他承認自己在戰鬥方面幫不上什麼忙，但至少能提供變裝用的衣服。於是他從儲藏處搬出幾件又舊又破的 tunic 和 slops，上頭滿是污漬和難聞的味道，卻正好能讓你們看起來像真正的流浪漢。Thancred 接過衣物向他致謝，接著轉向你，把計畫的細節說清楚──你必須換上這身破爛衣服，在營地裡四處開口乞求工作或零星報酬，讓大家知道最近多了幾個窮困潦倒的流民。等流言傳開，偽裝成 priest 的罪魁禍首自然就會注意到你們。</p>
      <p>你換上這一身又髒又舊的衣服，開始扮演這個並不討喜的角色。過去別人看見你，或許會以冒險者的身分熱情相迎，而現在，你只能以一名衣衫襤褸的陌生人身份上前，開口詢問是否有工作可做、能否給點錢糊口。Knerl 一開始還把你當成冒險者，禮節性地歡迎你，但當你以難民的姿態求助時，他立刻板起臉，斷言 Immortal Flames 不會為你這種人提供工作或酬勞，要你趕快離開。宣揚 Azeyma 教義的 Swaenhylt 則高談闡述太陽與探求之女神，勸你這個「needy child」打開內心、接納女神的光芒，保證在她的照耀下你將不再匱乏──然而除了一場冗長的說教之外，並沒有實際的幫助。Aurildis 更是顯得不耐，叫你別再打擾她，強調就算窮困也沒有資格隨意纏上任何人，乾脆回到 Drybone 外那片泥濘的池塘邊，跟你那群「同類」待在一起。Ermegarde 起初仍以商人的禮儀問候你，但在注意到你寒酸的打扮後，只得尷尬地表示自家販售的都是高級貨品，恐怕不適合你的荷包，勸你還是回到 Sandgate 北方池塘邊的同伴身邊比較好。就連一向樂於招呼餓肚子冒險者的 Adelstan，聽到你在找工作時也只能搖頭說沒有缺人，要你別再打擾他的說故事時間。你到處碰壁，卻也在這一個個冷漠回應中，逐漸聽出共同的關鍵：不管是在 Drybone 還是 Sandgate 附近，大家都知道有一群窮人聚集在池塘旁的臨時聚落。</p>
      <p>當你回到 Camp Drybone 與 Thancred 會合時，他笑說你還真有一套，十分擅長扮演惹人嫌的「累贅」。現在整個營地都在傳說有新來的流民，很顯然，你的演技足以讓人信以為真。雖然偽 priest 尚未現身，你們卻得到了一條重要線索：在 Sandgate 北方的池塘旁，有一個由窮人組成的簡陋聚落，遠離官方的視線，正好是「悄悄帶人失蹤」的理想地點。於是 Thancred 提議，把這場戲移師到那裡繼續演下去。你往東來到 Sandgate，接近池塘時，他早已在那裡等候。如果你一時忘了換回那套骯髒的衣服，他就會揶揄你沒有穿上 Isembard 費心準備的「好看服裝」，提醒你一旦穿回平日的冒險者打扮，目標早在你出手前就會察覺異狀。當你再次換上破爛衣物，站在池邊與他會合時，Thancred 打量了你一眼，打趣說你現在「簡直是為欺瞞而生的完美造型」。接下來要做的，就只有等待──等那位自稱關懷窮人的「好心 priest」主動上門。</p>
      <p>不久之後，一名披著長袍的男子走近，用充滿做作同情的語氣向你們說話，感嘆你們的生活實在太悲慘，根本算不上「人的生活」。他安撫你們不用害怕，自稱是 Order of Nald’thal 的 priest，專程前來為你們提供救濟。接著，他拿出那種你已經熟悉不過的 leaflet，宣稱這上面載有 Nald 的教導，只要信奉其中的內容，就能掙脫貧窮的鎖鏈，讓「Nald 的財富流入你們孩子的手中」。這正是引誘無數人離家出走的那套話術。Thancred 默默聽完整段說辭，最後卻用冷淡的口氣拒絕了這份「誘惑」──不是因為內容不動人，而是因為演技爛得令人難以卒聽。他指出，真正的 priest 不會這樣說話，也不會寫出這種文字。說完便一口氣撕下對方的偽裝，直呼其名：Ungust。假 priest 被叫出真名，嚇得縮了回去，一邊驚叫一邊意識到自己遭到誘捕，立刻開始求饒，聲稱自己這麼做只是為了保護同胞。</p>
      <p>在 Thancred 堅定的目光壓力之下，Ungust 只好把話說清楚。他承認自己是 Golden Bazaar 的一份子，在那裡長大。幾個月前開始，Amalj’aa 的突襲一波接著一波，像沙塵暴一樣突然出現，耀武揚威地搶掠、破壞。聚落的防禦力量太薄弱，根本無法抵擋，所有人都活在恐懼之中。Ungust 表示自己只是一名 merchant，所知道的只有做生意，因此他想到的唯一辦法，就是用商人的方式去「談判」──親自前去和 Amalj’aa 接觸，替 Golden Bazaar 爭取一條生路。作為不再襲擊聚落的條件，Amalj’aa 提出了種種要求，而且一項比一項離譜。第一條，是想要得到從 Nanawa Mines 運出的 crystal 出貨時刻表。為此，Ungust 偷偷收買礦山裡的工人，讓對方替他洩漏訊息。接著，他們要求「人」。為了滿足這項條件，他便動起歪腦筋：偽裝成 priest，拿著充滿虛假承諾的 leaflet，專門鎖定最脆弱的人們，假借救濟之名把他們一步步誘騙出來，然後交給 Amalj’aa。Ungust 一再辯解自己別無選擇，這一切都是為了保護自己的同鄉。</p>
      <p>然而 Thancred 並不買帳。他承認保護故鄉的心意本身值得敬佩，但如果代價是無辜者的生命，那就根本無法被稱為正當的行為。Ungust 完全可以選擇向 Immortal Flames 求援，卻偏偏走上出賣自己人這條路。Thancred 認為事情絕不只是「沒有選擇」那麼簡單，進一步逼問他真正的動機是什麼。Ungust 起初含糊地咕噥了幾句，在對方的再三追問下，終於爆出實話──「The coin was good.」Amalj’aa 給他的報酬好得難以想像，比起賣上好幾輩子的 mole meat 都賺不到的錢，這種輕鬆得來的酬勞更讓他欲罷不能。換句話說，他願意犧牲一個又一個無辜的人，只是為了填滿自己的腰包。Thancred 對此感到無以言喻的厭惡，只能說自己已經找不到任何足以表達輕蔑的字眼。即便如此，Ungust 仍試圖把責任推到你們、推到眾神、推到這個世界的亂象上，只是不願正視自己所做的選擇。Thancred 沒有放過他，接著質問最近 Immortal Flames 巡邏路線洩漏一事是否也和他有關。Ungust 驚慌失措地否認，發誓自己一無所知，但以他現在的可信度，很難讓人願意相信任何一句話。儘管如此，Thancred 並不打算當場把所有問題都問到底──眼前還有更重要的事。被誘拐的人們仍然下落不明，時間不容浪費。他決定先把 Ungust 押在身邊，慢慢榨乾他所知道的一切，並請你先回去向 Minfilia 報告這次的發現。</p>
      <p>你留下 Thancred 和那名囚犯，到 Western Thanalan 的 The Waking Sands，來到 Minfilia 所在的 The Solar。她面帶微笑迎接你，說很高興看見你與 Thancred 的合作順利。你把偽 priest 的真面目、Ungust 的背叛以及他與 Amalj’aa 達成的交易從頭到尾說了一遍，她全程神情專注地聽著，最後感謝你揭開真相。正如 Thancred 先前所言，接下來最重要的，就是弄清楚那些被綁走的人被帶到哪裡去，而這個答案目前恐怕只有 Amalj’aa 知道。要從他們口中套出情報，絕不會是輕鬆的事。Minfilia 預感在事情落幕之前，必然會有血流成河的一刻，但如果想把失蹤者救回來，Scions 就必須做好付出代價的覺悟。</p>
