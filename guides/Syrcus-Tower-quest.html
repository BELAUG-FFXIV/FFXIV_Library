    story:`<div class="clamp" data-collapsed="true"><p>You return to Rammbroes, expecting news of progress, and he greets you with the weary honesty of someone who has been hoping for a breakthrough that never comes. He admits there is nothing worthwhile to report—“disappointed” is the word of the day—and explains that while the Sons of Saint Coinach continue to uncover discoveries in the Labyrinth of the Ancients, the Crystal Tower itself remains sealed. No one has managed to set foot inside.</p><p>G’raha Tia reminds you how the Eight Sentinels once barred the way to the labyrinth, and says Syrcus Tower—the Allagans’ name for the principal spire—is protected in much the same manner, by technology far beyond what you can counter with familiar methods. He and Cid have tried every trick they know, yet nothing works, and they are forced to admit they have no answer. Rammbroes refuses to surrender to discouragement, but concedes that until an entry is found, your talents cannot be brought to bear; he decides his people must turn to ancient texts and search for a clue they have missed.</p><p>A new voice breaks in, offering assistance. Two strangers present themselves: Unei and Doga, claiming to be scholars of the Allagan civilization sent by the Students of Baldesion. Rammbroes notes how unusual their names sound in this age, and his caution hardens when he realizes no word of their coming ever reached him—especially with the recent incident at the Isle of Val weighing on everyone’s mind. Doga insists the message must have gone astray and repeats that they are here to help.</p><p>When Rammbroes turns to G’raha, G’raha brushes off a sudden pain that has already subsided. Unei’s attention fixes on him at once, remarking that G’raha’s right eye is the same as theirs. G’raha is shaken into open urgency: the red hue is said to be unique to the Allagans, yet he inherited it through his family line, and only one child in a generation is born with it. He has spent his life seeking the truth behind it, and he presses Unei and Doga for anything they might know.</p><p>Doga offers no explanation, only certainty: those who bear the trait are bound by fate to Allag. As G’raha’s eye has set him on his path, so too has their own drawn them here to fulfill a destiny that sounds absurd even as they speak it. G’raha argues there is nothing to lose by accepting their aid. Rammbroes agrees—on the condition that he will verify their story with the Students of Baldesion when he can—and formally names Unei and Doga advisory members of NOAH, directing them to examine the Syrcus Tower entrance. He asks you to accompany them, with Biggs and Wedge ready at the Eight Sentinels to guide you, and to report to Cid upon arrival. G’raha insists on joining you as well, trusting that Unei and Doga’s knowledge—combined with your knack for setting events in motion—will finally move the expedition forward.</p><p>At the Eight Sentinels, Wedge confesses that he and Biggs are combing rubble for any hint of a way in, and you can hear the desperation under his attempt at humor. Biggs greets you with his usual bluntness, joking that you are eager to get inside and kill everything in sight, then reiterates what you already know: Syrcus Tower is locked tight. When he hears you have brought new allies from the Students of Baldesion, his tone brightens—Cid has made no progress at all, and help is welcome—so he leads you straight to the chief.</p><p>Cid receives you with visible relief at familiar faces and curiosity at the new ones. G’raha introduces Unei and Doga as scholars of ancient Allag sent to assist. Doga says they hope to help with the tower’s defenses, and Cid, eyeing their attire, agrees it looks promising. He lays out the problem plainly: Syrcus Tower rises ahead, the main spire of the Crystal Tower, and the only entrance is the enormous gate before you. It will not open. Some unknown mechanism seals it shut, and even after Cid has tried everything from a pickaxe to a magitek cannon, the gate has not taken so much as a scratch. It does not incinerate you like the Eight Sentinels did, but that only makes its simple, perfect effectiveness more maddening.</p><p>G’raha points to the only clue—an elaborate device carved into the gate, depicting a man and a woman, which he judges to be Allagan royalty. Yet no one can say who they were or whether the carving serves any purpose at all. Cid warns you not to waste strength trying to force it. Unei agrees that strength should not be squandered, and Doga answers with calm certainty: why exert yourselves when the gate will open of its own accord? Before anyone can respond, the impossible happens—the gate opens. G’raha can only admit none of you expected that.</p><p>Cid demands to know what they did and what they are. A voice intrudes, reciting lines that praise the tower as a symbol of mankind’s glory, guarded by gates that answer only to royal blood—exactly as legend describes. Nero tol Scaeva steps forward, apologizing for interrupting your confusion, delighted by the “remarkable playthings” you have acquired. Cid recoils in disbelief that Nero is still alive. Nero replies with mocking familiarity, acknowledging you have every right to be wary after recent encounters, but insisting he is no longer a threat: his legion is effectively defunct, returning to Garlemald would mean execution, and so he has been wandering Eorzea as an itinerant. Hearing of your venture, he found it fascinating and decided to join.</p><p>Cid rejects him outright, incredulous after what Nero has done. Nero accepts the suspicion as deserved, yet claims he is determined to make amends. As a gesture of goodwill, he offers what he knows—beginning with Unei and Doga. The Crystal Tower, he says, was the symbol of ancient Allag’s might and prosperity, and entry was permitted only to royalty and a select few. In the records he uncovered, only royal blood can open the gate; the emperor and his progeny were living keys. G’raha leaps to the conclusion that Unei and Doga must be descended from Allagan royalty, but Nero shuts that down: they are not glamorous heirs, but imitations of royalty—living keys created by Allagan ingenuity. “Clones,” he calls them, using the term their creators gave their kind.</p><p>Doga concedes there is no point hiding any longer. He apologizes, insisting they never meant to deceive; they only wished to avoid causing undue alarm by voicing claims that would sound deranged if spoken too soon. Unei asks to return to the Eight Sentinels, promising there is much to explain. G’raha agrees. Cid, still reeling, demands if Nero truly intends to follow you around. Nero answers that he does—then offers a “gift” in the hope of reconciliation: an Allagan tomestone containing the information he shared and more besides, once jealously guarded by the XIVth Legion, now given to Cid with a pointed wish that he enjoy it. He ends by calling Cid an old friend and saying he looks forward to working together.</p><p>Back at the Eight Sentinels, Unei asks you to hear them out, saying they have waited a long time for the chance to fulfill their life’s purpose. G’raha urges that you listen first and decide what to do afterward. Cid warns that Nero cannot be trusted and must be watched. Nero, unfazed, insists the past is past and asks if yesterday’s enemies cannot become today’s friends. Biggs explains that Cid and Nero go back to the Magitek Academy, an elite school for the Empire’s brightest, and that they never got along—fate’s cruelty, he calls it, to throw them together again. Wedge shudders at the thought of the Allagans making copies of people, imagining what horrors could follow if such knowledge fell into the wrong hands.</p><p>When you are ready, Doga asks that Rammbroes be present for what he is about to reveal. He begins with another apology, repeating that deception was never their intent. Then he states the truth: they are not scholars sent by the Students of Baldesion. They are clones—copies of people who once existed—given life through Allagan technology. Rammbroes struggles to take it in, but asks why they were created and what they seek to do. Doga says the answers require a return to Allagan history, and asks for patience.</p><p>Unei explains that the Allagan Empire reached its zenith long before their kind existed. In that age, the Crystal Tower stood as a symbol of Allagan pride, and parents brought their children to learn how its near-limitless energy gave prosperity to the empire. Doga continues: prosperity bred decadence, stagnation followed, and without strong leadership the decline accelerated. Within generations, Allag became a shadow—cities decayed, frontier lands fell to wilderness. Unei says that one technologist, mourning this state, made it his mission to restore Allag. His name was Amon, and he believed the empire needed only a potent ruler—none more potent than its founding father, whom he sought to resurrect.</p><p>G’raha reacts in shock, realizing this must mean Emperor Xande. Unei confirms it. As part of his experiments, Amon created clones of the emperor’s descendants, and Unei and Doga are the products—copies of the original Unei and Doga. Rammbroes recalls that texts speak of two Allagan emperors named Xande and that it was long believed the second merely took the first’s name; the truth, he realizes, is that they were one and the same. Unei says Xande returned from the grave and reclaimed the throne, restoring the realm to former glory—yet he could not be satisfied.</p><p>Doga explains that in his previous life, Xande sought to bring the entire world under Allagan dominion, and though he failed, his resurrection gave him a second chance he was determined to seize. To conquer, he needed greater power, so he turned toward a forbidden source: darkness. To harness it, he converted the Crystal Tower into a restricted research facility. Cid reacts with disgust at yet another ruler chasing darkness for power, and tries to dismiss the threat by noting that Xande has been dead for thousands of years. Doga answers that he is not: Emperor Xande still abides within Syrcus Tower, his ambition burning even more fiercely after the empire’s fall.</p><p>Doga continues that wielding darkness demands prodigious energy—more than even the Crystal Tower could produce—so Dalamud was created and launched into the heavens to gather the sun’s energy and channel it to the tower. A miscalculation caused a surge that escaped into the land, triggering an earthquake of unprecedented violence: the calamity that ushered in the Fourth Umbral Era. In an instant, the Allagan Empire was laid to waste. Yet even as the Crystal Tower sank into the earth, Amon—now Xande’s closest aide—invoked powerful magicks and halted the flow of time. Every soul within the structure, the emperor included, was placed in deep slumber until the time was ripe to awaken.</p><p>Unei says eras passed, and after millennia of dormancy, Dalamud was called back to the earth. Its descent triggered the Seventh Umbral Calamity, and in its wake the Crystal Tower reemerged—at which moment Emperor Xande awakened. Unei says Xande, consumed by his lust for power, consorted with darkness and was seduced by its corrupting influence. Even with his empire now a fading memory, he will stop at nothing to realize his ambition. Unei declares that their purpose is to put an end to Xande’s madness, a mantle inherited from their namesakes—the true Unei and Doga—who, fearing for the world, tried to thwart their emperor and entrusted their will to these clones so the mission could continue if they failed.</p><p>Doga says that when he and Unei came to their senses within the Crystal Tower, they deliberated and realized they could not overcome Xande alone. They set out to find a worthy ally, and after years, their search is over. Anyone who can carve a path through the Labyrinth of the Ancients is no ordinary person; with you as their champion, they are confident Xande’s dark ambition can finally be ended. Cid admits this explains how they knew so much—because they were observing the investigation all along—and asks you what you will do now, since the world is in grave danger once more and you happen to be an expert at saving it. Doga gives thanks and urges that together you lay Allag’s dark past to rest.</p><p>Rammbroes acknowledges that NOAH’s mission has been to recover Allagan knowledge, but asks what that knowledge is worth if it endangers the realm. It pains him to think the tower’s secrets might be lost, yet the greater good must come first—and, he adds, no quantity of relics compares to Unei and Doga themselves, living and breathing Allagans. He declares a change in NOAH’s objective: from this point onward, all efforts will be directed toward sealing off Syrcus Tower so its dark secrets never see the light of day. He instructs you to enter the structure and eliminate hostile elements, including Emperor Xande himself, while the others examine ways to isolate the tower from the outside world.</p><p>G’raha stops him, needing to know one thing: his right eye is like theirs—does that mean something? Doga tells him not to worry; G’raha said he inherited the trait from his father, and clones cannot bear offspring, so there is no cause for concern on that count. What G’raha called the Allagan Eye, they call the Royal Eye, because it manifests only in those of royal blood. Doga cannot explain why the eye runs in G’raha’s line, but refuses to believe it is coincidence. He tells G’raha to be patient—though he is surely desperate to know the truth, all will be revealed in due time.</p></div><div class="expand-wrap"><button class="expand-btn" data-role="expand"></button></div>`,

data-collapsed="true"><p>あなたがラムブルースのもとを訪ねると、彼は調査の進捗を待ち望んでいたであろう声色で迎え、しかし報告できる成果がないことを恥じ入るように告げる。「失望」という言葉が今日の合言葉になりそうだ、とまで言い、古代の民の迷宮ではサンクレッドたちが日々新たな発見を重ねている一方で、クリスタルタワー本体には未だ一歩たりとも踏み込めていないのだと明かす。</p><p>グ・ラハ・ティアは、かつて八剣士の前庭が迷宮への道を阻んでいたことを思い出させ、同じように主塔への入口――アラグの呼称でシルクスの塔――もまた、現代の技術では太刀打ちできない防衛機構に守られていると言う。シドとともに考え得る手を尽くしたが成果はなく、正直なところ手詰まりだと認める。ラムブルースは落胆しつつも諦めはせず、必ず道はあると語り、しかし入口が開かねばあなたの力も活かせない以上、古文書を洗い直すしかないと決める。</p><p>そこへ、助力できるかもしれないという声が割って入る。現れたのはウネとドーガと名乗る二人で、バルデシオン委員会の学生たちから派遣されたアラグ文明の研究者だという。ラムブルースはその名が現代には珍しいと感じつつも、事前連絡が一切なかったこと、そしてヴァル島での一件が起きた直後であることから、疑念を隠さない。ドーガは、何らかの手違いで連絡が届かなかったのだろうとし、助けに来たのだと繰り返す。</p><p>ラムブルースがグ・ラハ・ティアの様子を問うと、グ・ラハ・ティアは一瞬の痛みがあったがもう収まったと言って取り繕う。だがウネは彼の右目を見て、こちらと同じだと口にする。グ・ラハ・ティアは動揺し、アラグ固有の特徴とされる紅い眼の色を自分は父から受け継いだのだと語り、さらにその眼は一世代に一人だけ生まれると伝えられていると明かす。真相を知るために生涯を費やしてきたのだと訴え、知っていることがあるなら教えてほしいと懇願する。</p><p>ドーガは答えを持たないと詫びつつ、ただ一つ確かなことがあると言う。その眼を持つ者は運命によってアラグに結びつけられているのだ、と。グ・ラハ・ティアの眼が彼をこの道へ導いたように、自分たちもまた使命を果たすためにここへ来たのだと語り、それが荒唐無稽に聞こえても真実だと断言する。グ・ラハ・ティアは、彼らの助力を受け入れて失うものはないと主張し、ラムブルースはそれを認める。ただし後日、バルデシオン委員会に確認するつもりだと告げ、異論はないなと釘を刺す。</p><p>ラムブルースはウネとドーガを調査団「ノア」の顧問として迎え入れ、まずはシルクスの塔の入口を調べさせようと決める。そしてあなたに二人の同行を頼み、八剣士の前庭で調査中のビッグスとウェッジが道案内できると言う。現地に着いたらシドへ報告し、状況説明を受けるよう指示する。グ・ラハ・ティアも同行すると言い、二人の知識と、あなたが事態を動かす不思議な力が合わされば、ようやく進展が得られるはずだと期待を口にする。</p><p>八剣士の前庭では、ウェッジが瓦礫を調べて手がかりを探しているが、必死になっているのが分かるだろうと自嘲気味に言う。ビッグスはあなたを見つけると、シルクスの塔に突入して片っ端から倒したいのだろうと冗談めかしつつ、塔が固く閉ざされている現状を改めて伝える。そこへバルデシオンの学生たちから来た新しい仲間がいると聞くと、シドの手が全く進んでいない状況を思い、助けは歓迎だと言ってあなたを案内する。</p><p>シドは旧知の顔に励まされ、新顔にも目を向ける。グ・ラハ・ティアがウネとドーガを紹介し、ドーガは防衛機構の突破に助力できればと述べる。シドはその装いからして頼りになりそうだと言い、現状を説明する。目の前にそびえるシルクスの塔はクリスタルタワーの主塔で、内部へ入る道は巨大な門のみだ。しかし門は開かず、仕組みは完全に不明だという。シドはつるはしから魔導砲まで試したが傷一つ付かず、八剣士の前庭のように灰にされることはないものの、単純で完璧な防衛がひどく苛立たしいと吐き捨てる。</p><p>グ・ラハ・ティアは門に刻まれた装置――男女一対の意匠――だけが手掛かりで、アラグの王族だろうと推測するが、正体も意味も分からず、飾りに過ぎない可能性すらあると言う。シドは力ずくは無駄だと諭す。ウネは力を無駄にしないと応じ、ドーガはむしろ、門が自ら開くのに力を使う理由があるのかと言い切る。次の瞬間、予想外にも門は開き、グ・ラハ・ティアは誰も想像していなかったと漏らす。シドは何をしたのか、お前たちは何者なのかと問い詰める。</p><p>そこへネロ・トル・スカエウァが姿を現し、天を貫き光を集める塔の伝承を詠い、王族の血にのみ応える門がまさに伝説通りだと喜ぶ。驚くシドに、ネロは軽口を叩きつつ警戒されて当然だと認め、しかし自分はもはや脅威ではないと言う。軍団は事実上瓦解し、ガレマールへ戻れば処刑が待つため、今は放浪しているのだと語る。そしてあなたたちの企てを耳にして興味を抱き、加わることにしたのだと告げる。</p><p>シドは過去の所業を思い出し、信用できるはずがないと拒む。ネロは疑われるのは報いだと言いながらも償う意志を示し、善意の証として知っていることを共有すると言う。まずはウネとドーガについて、クリスタルタワーは古代アラグの繁栄と威光の象徴であり、入ることを許されたのは王族と選ばれた者だけだったと述べる。記録によれば門を開けられるのは王族の血のみで、皇帝とその子孫は生きた鍵だったのだという。グ・ラハ・ティアは二人が王族の末裔なのかと問うが、ネロはそれを否定し、二人は王族の模倣、アラグ技術が生んだ生きた鍵だと言い切る。そして創造主が与えた呼び名――「クローン」――であると告げる。</p><p>ドーガは隠し立ての時は終わったと認め、騙す意図はなかったと謝罪する。多くの者が狂気と受け取るような話を早々に持ち出して混乱を招きたくなかっただけだと説明し、八剣士の前庭へ戻って話したいと言う。グ・ラハ・ティアは同意し、シドはネロが本気で付いてくるつもりかと呆れる。ネロは冗談ではないと返し、和解のための贈り物としてアラグのトームストーンを差し出す。今話した情報とさらに多くを収めたもので、かつて第十四軍団が厳重に保管していたが今はシドのものだと言い、「旧友」と呼んで共に働くのを楽しみにしていると告げる。</p><p>八剣士の前庭へ戻ると、ウネは疑われても仕方ないが話を聞いてほしいと頼み、長い間この機会を待っていたのだと言う。グ・ラハ・ティアはまず話を聞き、方針は後で決めればいいと促す。シドはネロは信用できないから常に監視すべきだと釘を刺し、ネロは昨日の敵が今日の友になれるのではないかと開き直る。ビッグスはネロとシドが魔導学院の同期で、昔から折り合いが悪かったと語り、運命の皮肉だと吐き捨てる。ウェッジは、人を複製できる技術が悪用されれば世界が恐ろしい場所になると震え、同じ顔のビッグスが何人もいる光景を想像して青ざめる。</p><p>準備が整うと、ドーガは真実を語る前にラムブルースにも同席してほしいと言う。重ねて詫び、彼らはバルデシオン委員会の学生に派遣された学者ではないと断言する。彼らはアラグの技術によって命を与えられた、かつて実在した者の写し身――「クローン」なのだ。ラムブルースは受け止めきれない様子を見せながらも、なぜ作られ、何を成そうとしているのかと問う。ドーガは、答えるにはアラグの歴史を振り返る必要があると述べ、しばし辛抱してほしいと言う。</p><p>ウネは、アラグ帝国が最盛期にあったのは自分たちが生まれるより遥か昔だと語り、その栄華の時代にクリスタルタワーは誇りの象徴としてそびえ、ほとんど無尽蔵のエネルギーが帝国全土に繁栄をもたらしたと説明する。だがドーガは、その繁栄が退廃を生み、停滞が始まり、強い指導者を欠いたことで衰退は加速したと言う。数世代のうちにアラグ文明は見る影もなくなり、都市は荒れ、辺境は荒野へと戻った。ウネはそれを嘆いたある技術者が、アラグを再び偉大にする使命を自らに課したと語る。名はアモン。彼は帝国に必要なのは強大な統治者だと考え、建国の父を蘇らせようとしたのだという。</p><p>グ・ラハ・ティアはそれが皇帝ザンデのことかと息を呑み、ウネはそうだと肯定する。アモンは実験の一環として皇帝の子孫のクローンを作り出し、自分たちはその産物――ウネとドーガの写し身だと言う。ラムブルースは、史料にはザンデの名を持つ皇帝が二人いると記され、後者は前者にあやかった名だと信じられていたが、実際は同一人物だったのだと悟る。ウネは、ザンデは墓から甦り再び玉座に就き、帝国をかつての栄光へ戻したが、満足できなかったと語る。</p><p>ドーガは、前世でザンデが世界をアラグの支配下に置こうとしたが果たせず、二度目の生でその野望を成し遂げようとしたと説明する。征服のための力を求め、禁忌の源――闇――へと目を向け、闇を操る術を得るためにクリスタルタワーを研究施設として封鎖したのだという。シドは権力者が闇に溺れることへの嫌悪を露わにしつつ、相手は太古の死者だろうと突き放そうとする。しかしドーガはそれを否定し、皇帝ザンデは今も生きており、シルクスの塔に留まっていると言い切る。帝国が滅んだ今こそ、野心はより燃え盛っているのだと。</p><p>闇の力を行使するには莫大なエネルギーが必要で、クリスタルタワーだけでは足りない。そこでダラガブが作られ天空へ打ち上げられ、太陽のエネルギーを集めて塔へ送る仕組みになった。だが計算違いで余剰が地上に漏れ、前代未聞の大地震――第四霊災を引き起こした。瞬く間にアラグ帝国は壊滅したが、沈みゆくクリスタルタワーの中で、アモンは強力な魔法で時の流れを止めた。皇帝を含む塔内の全員は深い眠りに落とされ、目覚めるべき時が来るまでそのまま眠り続けるはずだった。</p><p>ウネは、時代が移り変わり、長い眠りの後にダラガブが地上へ呼び戻され、その落下が第七霊災を引き起こし、その余波でクリスタルタワーが再び姿を現したと語る。その瞬間、皇帝ザンデは目覚めた。権力欲に駆られたザンデは闇と交わり、その腐敗に魅入られ、帝国が今や記憶の残滓であろうとも野望を捨てない。ウネは、彼らが存在する理由はただ一つ、ザンデの狂気を終わらせるためだと言い、真のウネとドーガが残した意志を受け継いだのだと述べる。彼らは世界の行く末を恐れ、皇帝を止めようとし、失敗した時のために自分たちへ意志を託したのだ。</p><p>ドーガは、塔の中で目覚めた後に方策を考え、自分たちだけでは勝てないと結論して盟友を探しに出たと言う。年月を経て、その探し求めた相手があなたなのだ。古代の民の迷宮を切り開ける者は並の者ではなく、あなたを旗印にすれば皇帝ザンデの闇の野望を終わらせられると確信している。シドは、だからこそ彼らがバルデシオン委員会のことまで含め多くを知っていたのだと納得し、あなたにどうするのかと問う。世界が再び危機に晒され、あなたはそれを救うことに慣れているのだと。ドーガは深い感謝を捧げ、アラグの闇の過去を葬ようと呼びかける。</p><p>ラムブルースは、アラグの知識を取り戻すことが使命だったが、それが世界を危険に晒すなら何の価値があるのかと自問する。秘奥が失われるのは辛いが、大義が常に先だと言い、さらに古代の遺物の量よりも、ウネとドーガという生きたアラグ人に勝るものはないと告げる。そして調査団「ノア」の目的を変更し、今後はシルクスの塔を封印することに全力を注ぐと宣言する。あなたには塔へ入り、敵対する存在を排除するよう求め、その中には皇帝ザンデも含まれると言い切る。外部から塔を隔離する方法は自分たちが探る、と。</p><p>グ・ラハ・ティアはそこで待ったをかけ、自分の右目が彼らと同じだということは何を意味するのかと問う。ドーガは、グ・ラハ・ティアは父から受け継いだと言っていたが、クローンは子を成せないため心配はいらないと告げる。そして彼が「アラグの眼」と呼んだものは、自分たちにとっては「ロイヤルアイ」だと言う。王族の血を引く者にのみ現れる特徴だからだ。なぜグ・ラハ・ティアの家系にそれがあるのかは説明できないが、偶然とは思わない。真実を焦るだろうが、時が来れば明らかになる、と耐えるよう促す。</p></div><div

    story:`<div class="clamp" data-collapsed="true"><p>你回到 Rammbroes 面前，他一見到你就像早已猜到你急著想聽結果，卻也只能苦笑著承認：今天最貼切的詞恐怕就是「失望」。他羞愧地說，實在沒有什麼值得報告的進展。Sons of Saint Coinach 仍在 Labyrinth of the Ancients 裡持續探查，天天都有新發現，但 Crystal Tower 本體卻完全不同——你們甚至連一步都踏不進去。</p><p>G’raha Tia 要你回想最初阻擋你們的是 The Eight Sentinels，並指出如今主塔入口也是同樣的局面。那座主塔在 Allag（古代亞拉戈帝國）的稱呼中叫 Syrcus Tower，入口被遠超你們技術水準的防衛機構守護。Cid 和他把能想到的手段全試過了，依舊毫無效果；他坦白承認，他們已經束手無策。Rammbroes 雖然沮喪，仍堅持不能放棄，說一定有辦法能進去；但在能進入之前，你的本事也派不上用場，因此他打算讓人回頭翻查手邊的古文獻，看看是否能找到突破口。</p><p>就在這時，一道陌生的聲音插了進來，說或許能幫上忙。G’raha Tia 追問對方是誰，對方先要你們放下戒心，說目標相同，並自稱 Unei，同行者叫 Doga，聲稱自己是研究 Allagan 文明的學者，受 Students of Baldesion 派來協助你們。Rammbroes 注意到他們的名字在這個年代格外罕見，卻立刻提出疑點：他從未收到他們要來的消息，而且 Isle of Val 近期才出事，Students of Baldesion 理應有更迫切的麻煩要處理。Doga 只能說大概是傳訊途中出了差錯，但他保證他們的確是來幫忙的。</p><p>Rammbroes 這時注意到 G’raha Tia 的反應，詢問他怎麼了。G’raha Tia 強忍著說只是短暫的疼痛，已經消退。Unei 卻立刻盯著他的右眼，說那隻眼睛和他們的一樣。G’raha Tia 情緒瞬間失控般追問：他們也有 Allagan Eye 嗎？他說那種深紅色被傳為 Allagans（古代亞拉戈帝國的人）獨有的特徵，但他是從父親那裡繼承來的；而且那隻眼睛是一個世代只會出現一名孩子。他一生都在追尋這特徵的真相，如今懇求 Unei 和 Doga 只要知道任何線索，都請告訴他。</p><p>Doga 鄭重道歉，說他們無法回答，只能確定一件事：擁有這特徵的人，命運必定與 Allag（古代亞拉戈帝國）相繫。正如那隻眼把 G’raha Tia 推上如今的道路，他們也同樣被引到這裡來完成自己的命運；聽起來或許荒唐，但他說這就是事實。G’raha Tia 認為接受他們的協助沒有損失，便問 Rammbroes 的意思。Rammbroes 同意照辦，但也表明等他有機會時，仍會向 Students of Baldesion 查證他們的說法，並要他們不要反對。</p><p>Rammbroes 當場宣布 Unei 與 Doga 成為 NOAH 的顧問成員，接著便要他們去檢視 Syrcus Tower 的入口。他請你陪同兩人前往 The Eight Sentinels，因為 Biggs 與 Wedge 正在那裡調查，他們能帶路；抵達後再向 Cid 報到，由他說明現況。G’raha Tia 也表示要與你同行，他說有了 Unei 與 Doga 的知識，再加上你那種總能讓事情動起來的本事，他相信終於能看到進展。</p><p>你到了 The Eight Sentinels，Wedge 說他們正在翻查瓦礫，希望能找到進入 Syrcus Tower 的線索，還苦笑問你是不是看得出他們已經急得走投無路。Biggs 則用一貫的語氣招呼你，半開玩笑說你肯定早就想衝進 Syrcus Tower 把能動的都打倒，但也提醒你：那地方像蚌殼一樣鎖得死死的。當他聽到你帶來了 Students of Baldesion 的新朋友，語氣立刻振奮起來——Cid 那邊進度幾乎是零，他一定會很感激這份援助。說完，他便帶你去見 Cid。</p><p>Cid 看到熟面孔先是鬆了口氣，接著打量 Unei 與 Doga。G’raha Tia 介紹他們是研究 ancient Allag（古代亞拉戈帝國）的學者，來協助調查。Doga 表示他們知道你們難以突破防衛，希望能盡一份力；Cid 望著他們的裝束，說看起來確實會非常有用，並開始說明局勢：眼前那座 Syrcus Tower 是整體 Crystal Tower 的主塔，而唯一能進去的路就是你們面前那扇巨大的門。問題是門打不開，它被某種機構封死，運作原理對他們而言完全是謎。Cid 說他連更粗暴的方式都試了，從十字鎬到 magitek cannon 全上，卻連一道刮痕都留不下。門雖不像 The Eight Sentinels 那樣把人燒成灰，但它以近乎嘲弄般的「簡單」達成了同樣牢不可破的效果，讓人挫敗至極。</p><p>G’raha Tia 指出他們唯一的線索，是門上雕刻著一個精緻的裝置圖樣：一男一女，依他判斷應是 Allagan（古代亞拉戈帝國的）王族。但究竟是誰、那圖樣是否真有用途，都無從得知，甚至可能只是裝飾。Cid 勸你別想用蠻力，因為毫無用處——看看他手上的繭就知道。Unei 回應他們不會浪費力氣；Doga 更進一步說，既然門會自己打開，何必勉強用力。下一瞬間，門竟真的開了。G’raha Tia 只能低聲說，沒有人料到會是這樣。</p><p>Cid 震驚之下質問他們做了什麼、到底是什麼人。這時 Nero tol Scaeva 出現，先以詩句般的語調吟出傳說：那座塔貫穿天際、聚集光芒，是人類榮光與力量的象徵，而守門的關卡只回應王族之血——正如傳說所述，他為此感到欣喜。他隨即道歉說打斷你們的困惑了，還稱讚你們帶來了「了不起的玩具」。Cid 不敢置信地喊出他的名字，驚問他竟然還活著。Nero 以戲謔口吻回應，說你們警戒他很合理，但他不再是威脅；他的軍團實質上已瓦解，而他若回到 Garlemald 只會等著上絞刑架，因此他如今在 Eorzea 流浪。他說自己聽聞你們的新行動，覺得非常有趣，便決定過來加入。</p><p>Cid 立刻拒絕，質問他做過那些事後還想讓人相信。Nero 說你們懷疑他是他應得的報應，但他決心彌補；作為善意，他願意分享所知，並先從 Unei 與 Doga 談起。他說 Crystal Tower 是 ancient Allag（古代亞拉戈帝國）權勢與繁榮的象徵，能進入的只有王族與少數被允許的人。依他挖出的紀錄，唯有王族之血能開門——換言之，皇帝與其子嗣就是「活的鑰匙」。G’raha Tia 立刻追問這是否代表 Unei 與 Doga 是王族後裔，Nero 卻否定，說沒那麼光鮮；他們不是王族血脈，而是王族的仿製品，是 Allagan（古代亞拉戈帝國的）技術造出的「活鑰匙」。他點出他們的本質就是 clones——那是創造他們的人對這種存在的稱呼。</p><p>Doga 承認隱瞞已無意義，再次道歉，說他們並非想欺騙你們，只是不想過早拋出會被人當成瘋言瘋語的說法而引發恐慌。Unei 請求回到 The Eight Sentinels，表示還有更多必須說明。G’raha Tia 同意。Cid 仍怒氣未消，質問 Nero 是否真打算一路跟著。Nero 回答他當然是認真的，還「送禮」作為和解的起點：一枚 Allagan tomestone（古代亞拉戈帝國的石板），裡面存著他剛才說的資訊，以及更多內容；那原本是 XIVth Legion 嚴密保管之物，如今交給 Cid，並說自己期待與「老朋友」合作。</p><p>回到 The Eight Sentinels 後，Unei 說你們完全有理由不信任他們，但仍懇求你們先聽完。他說他們等這個機會很久，只為完成一生的目的。G’raha Tia 主張先聽 Unei 與 Doga 解釋，再決定下一步也不遲。Cid 則提醒 Nero 絕對不可信，必須時刻盯著。Nero 卻反過來說既然過去已過，昨日的敵人也能成為今日的朋友，還問你是否同意。Biggs 說 Cid 與 Nero 早在 Magitek Academy 就認識——那是帝國菁英的學校——但兩人當年合不來，現在也一樣；命運把他們又拉在一起，實在惡劣。Wedge 則想到 Allagans（古代亞拉戈帝國的人）竟能複製人，一旦這種知識落入壞人手裡，世界會變得多可怕，甚至還忍不住想像一堆 Biggs 整天對他吼叫的畫面，嚇得吞了口水。</p><p>當你準備好聽真相時，Doga 說這件事與調查密切相關，Rammbroes 最好也在場。他先再次道歉，說他們確實不是 Students of Baldesion 派來的學者；他們是 clones，是 Allagan（古代亞拉戈帝國的）技術賦予生命、用來複製「曾經存在之人」的存在。Rammbroes 震驚之餘仍追問：他們為何被創造，又究竟想做什麼。Doga 表示要回答這些問題，必須回到 Allagan history（古代亞拉戈帝國的歷史），請你們耐心聽下去。</p><p>Unei 說 Allagan Empire（古代亞拉戈帝國）在他們這種存在誕生之前就已達到巔峰。那個光輝年代裡，Crystal Tower 高聳作為 Allagan（古代亞拉戈帝國的）驕傲象徵，父母會帶孩子前往，讓他們明白塔所產生的近乎無盡能量如何讓整個帝國繁榮。Doga 接著說，繁榮卻催生了奢靡與頹敗，帝國開始停滯，缺乏強而有力的領導更加速衰退；短短幾個世代，Allagan civilization（古代亞拉戈帝國的文明）就變成昔日榮光的蒼白影子，城市失修，邊境荒蕪。</p><p>Unei 說一名技術者不忍目睹這一切，決心讓 Allag（古代亞拉戈帝國）重返偉大。他名叫 Amon，認為帝國只欠缺一位足夠強大的統治者，而最強大的莫過於建國之父，因此他試圖讓那位存在復活。G’raha Tia 倒抽一口氣，問那是否就是 Emperor Xande。Unei 肯定。Amon 在實驗中創造了皇帝後裔的 clones，而他們正是那實驗的產物——Unei 與 Doga 的複製體。Rammbroes 說史書提到有兩位名為 Xande 的皇帝，人們以為後者只是以先祖為名；他難以置信地意識到兩者其實是同一人。Unei 說 Xande 從墓中歸來再登王座，如 Amon 預測般讓帝國重現榮光，但他終究不滿足。</p><p>Doga 說 Xande 前世曾企圖讓世界臣服於 Allagan 統治，野心最終落空；獲得第二次生命後，他決心成功。為了征服，他需要更強大的力量，於是把目光投向禁忌的來源：darkness。他將 Crystal Tower 變成受限制的研究設施，只為學會如何掌握那股力量。Cid 聽到「darkness」又一次出現，忍不住咒罵那些妄想者，並試圖用「他早就死了幾千年」來壓住不安。Doga 直接否定：Emperor Xande 仍然活著，就在 Syrcus Tower 裡，他的野心在帝國崩壞後反而燃得更烈。</p><p>Doga 說操縱 darkness 需要龐大能量，連 Crystal Tower 都不足以供應，因此才製造並發射 Dalamud 到天空，讓它在高處收集太陽能量並回輸到塔內。然而一次計算失誤，導致能量暴衝逸散至大地，引發史無前例的強震——也就是導致 Fourth Umbral Era 的 calamity。轉眼之間，強盛的 Allagan Empire（古代亞拉戈帝國）便崩毀殆盡。即便如此，當 Crystal Tower 正沉入地底時，Amon——此時已是 Xande 最親近的助手——施放強力魔法，停止了時間流動，讓塔內所有靈魂，包括皇帝本人，都陷入深沉睡眠，直到該甦醒的時刻到來。</p><p>Unei 接續說，漫長的年代過去後，Dalamud 被召回地面，它的墜落引發 Seventh Umbral Calamity，而 Crystal Tower 也在那之後重新現世；就在那一刻，Emperor Xande 醒了。Unei 說他被權力欲驅使，與 darkness 為伍並受其腐化，即便帝國如今只剩模糊的殘影，他仍不惜一切要實現野心。他斷言他們存在的目的只有一個：終結 Xande 的瘋狂。他們承接的是「真正的」Unei 與 Doga 的使命——那兩人恐懼世界遭逢的命運，曾試圖阻止皇帝，並把意志託付給他們這些 clones，讓任務即使在失敗後也能延續。</p><p>Doga 說他們在 Crystal Tower 內甦醒後商議對策，認定僅靠自己無法戰勝 Xande，因此離開去尋找值得信賴的盟友；多年追尋後，終於找到了你。他說能在 Labyrinth of the Ancients 開路的人絕非尋常之輩，只要你成為他們的 champion，他們就有把握終結 Xande 的 dark ambition。Cid 苦笑承認自己太早下結論了，也終於明白他們為何知道 Students of Baldesion 等許多情報——他們一直在觀察你們的調查。他轉而問你：現在該怎麼做？世界又一次陷入巨大危機，而你偏偏最擅長拯救它。Doga 向你致上永恆的感謝，請你與他們一起讓 Allagan Empire（古代亞拉戈帝國）的黑暗過去真正安息。</p><p>Rammbroes 聽完後坦言：NOAH 的使命本是找回失落的 Allagan 知識，但若那知識意味著把世界推向危險，又有何價值？他確實痛苦於可能失去塔的秘密，然而大義必須優先；更何況，再多的 relic 也比不上眼前的 Unei 與 Doga——活生生的 Allagans（古代亞拉戈帝國的人）。他當場宣布改變 NOAH 的目標：從今以後，全力封鎖 Syrcus Tower，讓其中的黑暗秘密永遠不得見光。他命令你像在 Labyrinth of the Ancients 一樣進入塔內清除敵對者，而其中當然包括 Emperor Xande；其餘人則會研究如何從外界隔離 Syrcus Tower，立刻著手行動。</p><p>G’raha Tia 忽然叫住眾人，他必須知道：他的右眼與他們相同，這是否代表什麼。Doga 說 G’raha Tia 提過那是從父親繼承而來，而 clones 無法繁衍後代，所以他不用擔心那方面的問題。他說你們稱之為 Allagan Eye，但在他們那裡這叫 Royal Eye，因為那特徵只會出現在擁有王族血統的人身上。他無法解釋為何這隻眼會出現在 G’raha Tia 的家系中，但他不認為那是巧合；即使 G’raha Tia 迫切想知道真相，也請他耐心等待——一切終會在適當的時刻揭曉。</p></div><div class="expand-wrap"><button class="expand-btn"
