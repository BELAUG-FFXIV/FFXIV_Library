    story:`<div class="clamp" data-collapsed="true">
<p>In a bustling Kugane tavern, a shifty Eorzean man tried and failed to blend into the crowd. Spotting you, he all but pounced, asking if you were an adventurer who was “good at killing and whatnot,” and quickly admitted he himself was hopeless at such things. What he did have, however, was a “job” he was desperate to unload on someone capable. Breathlessly, he spoke of a Miqo’te girl from Eorzea—“incredible, beautiful, wonderful”—who had traveled alone all the way to this strange Far Eastern city where people bowed and knelt in unfamiliar ways. In his imagination, the streets teemed with villains waiting to trick her and force her into unspeakable “things.” Worked up into a panic, he finally blurted out his request: slip into the tavern, keep her safe, and let him watch from a distance. True to his “conspicuously inconspicuous” nature, he clearly had no intention of approaching her himself—only of guarding her from the shadows.</p>
<p>Inside, the “Miqo’te girl” turned out to be none other than Nashu Mhakaracca, cheerfully asking a talkative Namazu named Gyodo if he had seen a “gentlemanly Eorzean.” Gyodo, who insisted he was a “catfish,” not a “talking cat,” claimed to know exactly where this man was and offered to guide her—provided she could afford his services. Unfortunately, Nashu had spent her last gil on the fare to Kugane and had nothing left to pay him with. Just then you arrived, and her face lit up as she greeted you, half-jokingly asking if you had really come all this way just to help her. She explained how, when Inspector Hildibrand shot into the sky yet again, she vowed not to lose him this time and immediately began looking for ways to travel as far east as possible—because you can’t get much farther east than the Far East. To her relief, Gyodo had claimed to know the inspector’s whereabouts. However, the Namazu’s thoughts betrayed him; realizing you understood the situation, he grew nervous under your stare, hastily retracted any mention of a fee, and then fled with some flimsy excuse about a pressing engagement. Nashu was left calling after “little Gyoza,” belatedly realizing he had been trying to swindle her and scolding herself for trusting a talking “cat” so easily.</p>
<p>After Gyodo’s abrupt departure, Nashu admitted she had already questioned many people in Kugane about a “gentlemanly Eorzean,” but no one had given her a useful lead. She gazed around the unfamiliar city, wondering aloud where Inspector Hildibrand could possibly be. You offered your thoughts—perhaps he had ended up stuck headfirst in the ground or lodged in the side of a building again, as he so often did, or perhaps his uncanny sense for cases had carried him straight into some new mystery. Nashu recalled how he had once landed in a snowbank right where Gigi was waiting, as if fate itself had dropped him into the perfect place at the perfect time. That memory sparked an idea: if Hildibrand was always chasing after cases, then the surest way to find him was to track down the biggest, juiciest incident in town and wait for him to appear. With renewed determination, she urged you to help her “go and see what trouble we can turn up,” and together you set off into Kugane, following rumors of unrest and mischief.</p>
<p>Your inquiries soon led you to local voices. A watchful man named Kyusen explained that several properties belonging to wealthy merchants had been pillaged over the past fortnight. The most recent victim was Master Akebono, whose shop in the Rakuza District had been hit only that morning. Though Kyusen assured you that the Sekiseigumi would inevitably catch the culprit—no thief was perfect, after all—it was clear the case remained unsolved. At the Bokaisen, Amaji confirmed Kugane’s less savory reputation, remarking that in a city like this, dastardly deeds were hardly rare. Lately, the talk on everyone’s lips concerned a mysterious thief preying upon the richest residents; some even suggested that anyone foolish enough to flaunt his fortune without proper protection deserved what he got, though Amaji quickly insisted he would never say such a thing himself. Between the two accounts, a picture emerged: someone was systematically targeting the city’s wealthiest merchants, and Master Akebono’s shop was the latest—perhaps most important—scene of the crime.</p>
<p>In the Rakuza District, you and Nashu arrived just in time to see a well-dressed samurai take his leave of a prosperous-looking merchant. The young man—Shigure of the Sekiseigumi—was vowing to bring a “fiendish” thief to justice and thanking Master Akebono for his cooperation when he turned too quickly and collided with Nashu. Flustered, he apologized profusely, offering to summon a healer, but Nashu waved off his concern and instead asked if he was one of the city’s famed samurai. Shigure introduced himself with formality, then reluctantly excused himself, explaining that duty compelled him to continue the hunt for a nefarious criminal at large. As he hurried off, Nashu muttered about “competition,” insisting that Inspector Hildibrand and his faithful assistants would not lose to the likes of him. Convinced that Akebono must hold valuable information if the Sekiseigumi were so intent on speaking with him, she marched up to the merchant, announced herself as Nashu, “agent of inquiries” and “extraordinary inspector,” and introduced you as a fellow investigator before asking him to share the details of the robbery.</p>
<p>Akebono, having heard rumors that inspectors from the West had arrived in Kugane, seemed inclined to trust you and agreed to cooperate. Early that very morning, one of his assistants had found the shop’s door unlocked. Venturing inside, the man discovered that Akebono’s most prized possessions had vanished, and in their place lay a single mocking message: “You have just been robbed by the Kugane Wolf Burglar!” Similar calling cards had been found at other crime scenes, Akebono explained, and now he, too, had joined the list of victims. Nashu’s eyes gleamed at the mention of a thief who left a signature behind; a series of robberies with a dramatic calling card was exactly the sort of case Hildibrand would find irresistible. Akebono confessed that he had assumed you were the very inspectors in question, but in truth he cared little who solved the crime, so long as someone did—especially since the Sekiseigumi themselves seemed to be at a loss. He promised generous rewards for any information that led to the recovery of his stolen goods and bade you success in your investigation, effectively delegating the Wolf Burglar case to you and Nashu.</p>
<p>With their goal now clearly defined, Nashu declared that all they had to do was stick like glue to the Wolf Burglar case and Inspector Hildibrand would surely appear. She called it her “keen inspector’s assistant sense,” and though she faltered over the phrase, her confidence never wavered. She resolved to learn more about the previous robberies and told you to seek her out again if you uncovered anything of note. Later, as she practiced dramatic lines to intimidate the unseen thief, she promised that “Mister Wolf Burglar’s days of wolf burglaring were numbered” and cheerfully vowed to put a fresh batch of “Nashu’s Delights” to good use next time—only to be distracted mid-speech by a peculiar shape in the sky. What she had taken for a strange green rooster turned out, of course, to be Inspector Hildibrand himself, once more having crashed into the Far East in the most ridiculous way imaginable. Calling for him to stop fooling around and come join the hunt, she sighed in relief that she had plenty more explosives stashed away. The stage was set: Nashu was on the case, the Wolf Burglar was on the prowl, and the Manderville inspector had—quite literally—arrived.</p>

<p>クガネのとある酒場で、いかにも胡散臭いエオルゼア人の男が、妙に目立たないふりをしながらも落ち着きなく周囲をうかがっていた。彼はあなたを見つけるや否や飛びつくように声をかけ、「冒険者で、人を……いや、モンスターを倒すのが得意なのだろう？」と前置きしてから、自分はそういうことがまるでダメだと打ち明ける。せいぜいネズミ退治程度しかできないという男には、ただひとつ頼みたい仕事があった。彼の話によれば、酒場にはエオルゼアから来たミコッテの少女がいるという。信じられないほど美しく、素晴らしく、かけがえのない存在で、彼はすっかり心を奪われていたらしい。しかし、いつも礼をして地にひざまずき、足を畳んで座るような見慣れない文化のこの地で、若い娘がひとり旅をするのはあまりに危険だと、彼は真剣に案じていた。悪い連中にだまされ、連れ去られ、何か「よからぬこと」をさせられるかもしれない、と妄想は膨らむ一方だ。息を切らしながら彼が絞り出した依頼は、そんな彼女をこっそり守ってほしいというものだった。自分は遠くから見守るだけの「沈黙の守護者」でいたいらしく、決して正面から声をかけるつもりはないようだった。</p>
<p>中へ入ると、そのミコッテの少女がナシュ・マカラッカであることがすぐにわかった。彼女は「紳士的なエオルゼア人」を探しており、ナマズオ族のギョドウに声をかけていた。ナシュは親しげに「しゃべるネコさん」と呼んだが、ギョドウは「正しくはナマズオだ」と言いながらも、彼女が探している人物を見たことがあると語り、その所在まで案内できると申し出る。ただし、そのサービスは無料でも安くもない、と念を押す。ところがナシュは、クガネ行きの船賃を払った時点で最後のギルまで使い切ってしまっており、支払いのあてがまったくなかった。そこへあなたが現れると、ナシュはぱっと顔を輝かせ、「こんな遠くまで助けに来てくれたの？」と冗談半分に声をかける。彼女は、ヒルディブランドが再び空へと吹き飛ばされたその瞬間、「今度こそ見失ってなるものか」と決意し、東へ東へと向かう手段を探し続けてきたのだと語る。行けるところまで行けば、行き着く先は極東──ファーイースト──だと信じて。そんな折に現れたギョドウが、紳士的なエオルゼア人の居場所を知っていると言ってくれたのだと喜んでいた。だが、あなたの険しい視線に気づいたギョドウは内心で警戒し始め、「急用ができた」と言って、先ほどの報酬の話もなかったことにすると言い残し、慌ててその場を逃げ出してしまう。残されたナシュは「ギョーザ」と呼びかけながらも、ようやく自分が危うくナマズオの詐欺に引っかかるところだったと気づき、「しゃべるネコをそう簡単に信じちゃダメだよね」と反省するのだった。</p>
<p>ギョドウが逃げ去ったあと、ナシュは肩を落とし、すでにクガネのあちこちで「紳士的なエオルゼア人」を見かけなかったかを尋ね回ったが、誰からも有力な手がかりは得られなかったと打ち明ける。見知らぬ街を見渡しながら、「インスペクター・ヒルディブランドはいったいどこにいるのかな」とつぶやく彼女に、あなたはいくつかの可能性を示す。いつものように地面や建物の壁に頭から突き刺さっているのかもしれないし、あるいは鋭い事件感に導かれて、すでにどこか別の場所で新たな事件に巻き込まれているのかもしれない、と。ナシュは、雪原の中に頭から突き刺さった彼が、まさにギギのいる場所に落ちてきたときのことを思い出す。まるで運命が、必要なときに必要な場所へと彼を放り込んだかのようだった。その記憶が、ひとつのひらめきをもたらす。インスペクターがいつも事件を追い求めているのなら、彼を見つけるいちばんの近道は、この街でいちばん大きくて面白そうな事件を探し出し、その現場で彼を待つことではないか、と。こうしてナシュは再び闘志を燃やし、「さあ、一緒にこの街で一番やっかいな事件を見つけよう！」とあなたを誘い、ふたりはクガネのあちこちで怪しげな話を求めて歩き出す。</p>
<p>やがて、ふたりは地元の人々から噂話を聞き出すことに成功する。見回り中のキュウセンという男は、ここ数週のあいだに裕福な商人たちが所有する屋敷や店舗が次々と荒らされる事件が起きていると教えてくれた。直近で被害に遭ったのは、楽座街に店を構えるアケボノだという。キュウセンは、赤誠組がいずれ必ず犯人を捕まえると自信ありげに語り、「完璧な盗人など存在しない」と言い切るが、現時点ではまだ決め手に欠けていることも見て取れる。募会船では、アマジという女性が、クガネでは悪事や怪しい行為など珍しくもないと半ばあきれた口調で話してくれた。ここ最近の話題は、街でもっとも裕福な者たちが正体不明の盗人に狙われているという噂であり、「財を見せびらかすだけ見せびらかして守ろうとしない愚か者は、自業自得だ」と陰口を叩く者もいるらしい（もちろん、彼女自身はそんなことは言わないと付け加える）。キュウセンとアマジの話を合わせると、標的が絞られた連続強盗事件が起きており、その最新の現場こそアケボノの店であることが浮かび上がってくるのだった。</p>
<p>楽座街に向かったふたりは、ちょうど裕福そうな商人と若い侍が話を終える場面に出くわす。その侍──赤誠組のシギュル──は、卑劣な盗人を必ず裁きにかけると約束し、アケボノに礼を述べて店を後にしようとしたところで、勢い余ってナシュとぶつかってしまう。シギュルは慌てて謝罪し、治癒士を呼んだほうがよいかと申し出るが、ナシュは頭を軽くさすりながら、「これくらいの頭突きは慣れっこだから平気」と笑い飛ばし、逆に彼が侍であるかを尋ねる。シギュルは丁重に名を名乗り、ひとたび自己紹介を済ませると、今は凶悪な犯罪者を追跡中であり、急ぎその足取りを追わねばならないと苦々しげに告げて立ち去る。彼の背中を見送りながら、ナシュは「ライバル出現」とばかりに眉をひそめ、「紳士探偵ヒルディブランドとその忠実な助手が、簡単に負けるわけにはいかない」と不敵に言い放つ。そして、シギュルがあそこまで熱心に話を聞いていたのなら、アケボノは何か重要な情報を握っているはずだと判断し、商人のもとへと駆け寄る。自らを「エージェント・オブ・インクワイアリーズ、超絶優秀なインスペクター・ナシュ」と名乗り、あなたも事件に強い相棒だと紹介して、最近の強盗事件について聞かせてほしいと頼むのだった。</p>
<p>アケボノは、西からやって来た「インスペクターたち」の噂をすでに耳にしていたようで、あなたたちを信用に足る人物と見なしたのか、静かに頷いて話し出す。その朝早く、店の助手が店先の扉が開いているのを見つけ、中を調べに入ったところ、店主の自慢の品々がごっそりと盗まれていたのだという。さらにひどいことに、空になった陳列棚には、こんな文言が記された紙切れが残されていた。「『クガネ・ウルフバーグラー』がいただいていった」と。アケボノによれば、最近の被害現場では同じような「名乗り」の書かれたメッセージが見つかっており、その犯人像が「クガネの狼盗人」として知られるようになったらしい。ナシュは、犯行現場にわざわざ名刺代わりのメッセージを残していくという派手な手口を聞いて目を輝かせる。連続強盗に、自ら名を刻みつける怪盗──そんな事件に、紳士探偵ヒルディブランドが惹かれないはずがないと確信するのだった。アケボノは、当初は目の前のふたりこそ噂のインスペクターだと思っていたと明かすが、誰が犯人を捕まえようと構わないとも付け加える。何よりも問題なのは、赤誠組でさえ決め手を欠いているという事実だ。そこで彼は、盗まれた品々を取り戻す手掛かりをもたらしてくれる者には、惜しみない報酬を支払うと約束し、あなたたちに調査を託すのだった。</p>
<p>こうして標的がはっきりしたことで、ナシュは顔を上げ、「あとはこの『ウルフバーグラー』の事件をとことん追い続ければ、インスペクターも必ず現れる」と力強く宣言する。彼女はそれを自分の「敏腕インスペクター助手センス」と呼び、言い回しに少しつまずきながらも、自信だけは揺るがない。これから自分は、ほかの被害現場や噂話も徹底的に調べてみるから、あなたも何か面白い情報をつかんだらすぐに知らせてほしいと頼む。その後、ひとりになったナシュは、見えない犯人に向かって決め台詞の練習を始める。「ウルフバーグラーの犯行は、もう長くは続かないよ！」と息巻き、今度こそ自慢の爆弾菓子「ナシュ特製デライト」を存分に使ってやると張り切っていたが、その途中で空に浮かぶ妙な緑色の物体に目を留める。一瞬「緑色のニワトリ」に見えたそれこそ、当然のごとく、またしても奇妙な姿勢で極東に落ちてきたヒルディブランドにほかならなかった。彼女は「インスペクター、遊んでないで一緒に事件を追いましょう！」と大声で呼びかけ、まだまだ手元にたくさんの「ナシュ特製デライト」があることにほっと胸を撫で下ろす。こうして、ナシュは事件を追う覚悟を固め、ウルフバーグラーは街を騒がせ続け、そしてマンデヴィル流の紳士探偵は、文字どおり空からこの物語に降ってきたのだった。</p>

    story:`<div class="clamp" data-collapsed="true">
<p>在熱鬧的 Kugane 酒館裡，一名「刻意低調卻又極為顯眼」的 Eorzean 男子，正試圖假裝自己融入人群。他看到你時幾乎是用衝的靠過來，先確認你是不是冒險者，是不是那種「很會打打殺殺」的人，接著就坦承自己完全不擅長戰鬥──除了偶爾打打老鼠之外。他真正擁有的並不是武力，而是一份讓他苦惱已久、卻非得拜託別人的「工作」。他語氣急促地提起一位 Miqo’te 少女──「不可思議、漂亮、完美無缺」的女孩，和你一樣從 Eorzea 遠道而來，現在就待在這間酒館裡。對他來說，這個女孩實在太美、太重要了。在這個處處鞠躬、跪坐、把腿收在身後的奇妙國度裡，一個年輕女孩獨自旅行實在太危險，總會有「壞壞的人」想騙走她、逼她做些說不出口的事……在這樣的妄想中越說越激動的他，最後總算吐露自己的請求：希望你能進去暗中保護她，而他會在遠處默默「看著」。從頭到尾，他都沒有打算親口對女孩說話，只想當一個自稱「沉默守護者」的影子。</p>
<p>走進酒館，你很快就認出那名 Miqo’te 少女正是 Nashu Mhakaracca。她正一臉純真地向一名自稱 Gyodo 的 Namazu 詢問，有沒有看見「紳士的 Eorzean」。Nashu 習慣性地叫對方「會說話的貓先生」，Gyodo 則強調自己其實是「貓魚」，並表示與其說他懂 Eorzean，不如說他根本不在乎。不過，他確實看過 Nashu 要找的那位「紳士」，而且還願意帶她去找，只是服務並不免費，也不便宜。可惜 Nashu 說，她早就把最後一點 gil 花在搭船來 Kugane 的船票上，如今身上半個銅板都沒剩。就在這時，你出現在她身後，她驚喜地叫住你，半開玩笑地問你是不是專程為了她跑到遙遠的東方來。她敘述起自己的經過：當 Inspector Hildibrand 又一次被打上天時，她心想「Nashu，這次說什麼都不能再讓他逃了！」於是立刻開始想辦法往更東邊前進，能東就東，最後就來到名副其實的 Far East。原本她還擔心自己找不到 Inspector，結果 Gyodo 這個會說話的「Numa Numa」卻說知道他在哪裡。只是 Gyodo 的內心顯然在打著別的算盤，察覺你看穿他意圖時，他在心裡暗叫不妙，立刻賣力否認自己有什麼「詐騙計畫」，當場收回剛才提過的費用，胡亂找個藉口說有「非常緊急的事」要先走，匆忙溜之大吉。Nashu 面對他轉身逃跑的背影，這才恍然大悟，小小地驚呼「原來小 Gyoza 一直在坑我啊！？」然後又自我吐槽，「Nashu 啊，你怎麼可以那麼輕易就相信一隻會說話的貓呢……」</p>
<p>Gyodo 一走，Nashu 說自己已經在 Kugane 問了很多人有沒有看過「紳士的 Eorzean」，卻沒有一個給得出像樣的線索。她望著陌生的街景喃喃自語：「Inspector Hildibrand 究竟在哪裡呢？」你提出自己的推測──也許他又像往常那樣頭朝下卡在地裡，或整個人插在建築物牆上，又或者，被他那敏銳又一根筋的「事件嗅覺」帶到某個新的案發現場去了。Nashu 回想起那次在雪地裡，他正好以頭朝下的姿勢掉進雪堆，偏僅就落在 Gigi 所在的位置，彷彿命運刻意把他丟進正確的地點與時間。這段記憶讓她靈光一閃：既然 Inspector 永遠都在追著案件跑，那要找到他，最簡單的方法就是先找到這座城市裡最大、最「多汁」的一樁案件，然後在現場等他出現就好。於是她眼睛一亮，興奮地說：「那我們就去找最厲害的壞人吧！」就這樣，你和 Nashu 開始在 Kugane 四處打聽，看哪裡有麻煩正在醞釀。</p>
<p>不久後，你們從當地人那裡拼湊出一幅清楚的畫面。巡邏中的 Kyusen 提到，過去半個月內，有好幾處屬於富裕商人們的宅邸或店鋪遭到洗劫。最近一次的受害者就是 Rakuza District 裡的商人 Akebono，他的店鋪才在今早被人「光顧」。Kyusen 雖然信心滿滿地說 Sekiseigumi 終究會抓到犯人──沒有完美的盜賊──但你聽得出來，事情目前仍然毫無頭緒。另一邊，在 Bokaisen 裡，Amaji 則用一種半調侃、半無奈的語氣說，像 Kugane 這樣的城市，壞人和可疑行為從來不缺。最近大家最愛談論的，就是有個神祕盜賊專挑城裡最富有的人下手，有人甚至酸溜溜地說，「如果有人愚蠢到只會炫耀財富卻不願好好防範，那被偷也活該」，當然她立刻澄清，那可不是她會說的話。綜合這些情報，可以確定：某個盜賊正在系統性地鎖定 Kugane 上流商人下手，而 Akebono 的店，就是最新、也可能是關鍵的一個案發現場。</p>
<p>於是你和 Nashu 來到 Rakuza District，正好看到一位打扮體面的侍衛從一間氣派的店裡走出來。那名年輕人──Sekiseigumi 所屬的 Shigure──正在向店主保證，一定會將那個卑劣的盜賊繩之以法，並向 Akebono 道別。沒想到轉身太急，一頭就撞上了 Nashu。Shigure 趕緊道歉，還提議要不要叫 healer 來看看，但 Nashu 頭一摸就說小小撞一下早就習慣，不用大驚小怪，反倒好奇地追問他是不是傳聞中的 samurai。Shigure 鄭重地自稱「Shigure」，表明自己是為了追捕惡徒在此辦案，雖然很想好好彌補這場小意外，但職責在身，只能先行離開。看著他匆匆離去的背影，Nashu 一邊揉著額頭，一邊嘟囔：「還有競爭對手啊……不過呢，Inspector Hildibrand 跟他最忠實的助手們，可不會輸給這種人！」認定剛剛那位商人一定掌握重要情報，她立刻大步上前，自我介紹為「Nashu，agent of inquiries！extraordinary inspector！」，並把你介紹成也擅長破案的夥伴，開門見山地請 Akebono 說明最近被偷的經過。</p>
<p>Akebono 說，他早就聽說有「inspectors」從西方來到 Kugane，如今看你們的樣子，也確實像是值得信賴的人。於是他坦然道出真相：今天一大早，他的一名助手發現店門居然沒鎖，進去查看後才驚覺，店裡最珍貴的收藏品全被搬空。更糟的是，原本陳列珍品的地方留下了一張紙條──上面寫著：「You have just been robbed by the Kugane Wolf Burglar!」這種帶有名號與嘲諷味道的留言，最近在其他被盜現場也屢屢出現，因此那名盜賊現在被稱作「Kugane Wolf Burglar」。聽到這裡，Nashu 眼睛立刻發光：連續竊案、專門留下 calling card 的怪盜──這種案件，Inspector Hildibrand 怎麼可能忍得住不跳進來參一腳？Akebono 則略帶尷尬地說，原本他還以為你們就是傳聞中的 inspectors，不過說到底，他並不在乎究竟是誰把犯人抓到，只要有人能解決這件事就好，反正連 Sekiseigumi 目前都毫無頭緒。於是他向你們承諾，只要能提供找回失物的關鍵線索，他會給予相當優渥的報酬，並把調查「Wolf Burglar」的重責，大方地交到你和 Nashu 手上。</p>
<p>有了明確的目標之後，Nashu 當場下定決心，只要緊緊咬住這起「Wolf Burglar」連續竊案不放，Inspector Hildibrand 絕對會自己送上門。她把這稱作自己「敏銳的 inspector 助手直覺」，雖然那句話說得有點打結，但信心卻十分堅定。她表示接下來要去多打聽其他被害人的情況，如果你找到什麼有趣的線索，就來找她。稍後，她獨自一人練習起對犯人放話的台詞，一邊揮舞手中的道具，一邊宣告：「‘Mister Wolf Burglar’ 你的狼行為日子不多了！」還得意洋洋地說下次一定要好好派上「Nashu’s Delights」這些小傢伙的用場。就在她正說得起勁時，忽然瞥見天邊有個奇怪的綠色影子。起初，看起來就像一隻莫名其妙的「綠色公雞」，但仔細一看，她立刻尖叫：「那是 Inspector Hildibrand！」原來，他又一次以完全不科學的姿勢墜落在 Far East 的天空下。Nashu 朝他大喊，叫他別再一個人胡鬧，快點加入他們的行列，同時慶幸自己還有大把「Nashu’s Delights」藏在身上。就這樣，Nashu 正式接下了 Wolf Burglar 案，城裡的怪盜仍逍遙法外，而那位 Manderville 紳士探偵，也再一次以最誇張的方式，闖進這場東方奇案之中。</p>
