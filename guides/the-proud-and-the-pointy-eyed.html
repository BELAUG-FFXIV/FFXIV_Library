<p>Cyr asks you to meet with him in private, his expression more troubled than before. Since your last encounter, he has been scouring the inquisition’s archives for any mention of temporal magicks, and what he found unsettles him. In the Enchiridion, ancient Allag is held up as a warning─a mighty empire laid low by vanity and hubris─yet certain apocryphal texts paint the Allagans in a more sympathetic, even exalted light. It is in those fringe writings that Cyr found references to temporal spells once wielded by Allagan mages: magicks capable of “halting” or even “reversing” the temporal state of a given object. If these accounts are true, and if Gigi’s powers are of the same nature, then it may indeed be possible for the mammet to turn back the hands of time for the Grand Sers, just as he restored the duke’s shattered vase. But living beings are not the same as inanimate crockery. Cyr asks you to imagine the vase full of water when it broke: if time were turned back, what happens to that water? Does the vessel return already filled, with every drop exactly as it was? Is it different water altogether? Or is the spilled liquid simply gone forever? He says he speaks of the soul. Even if one could restore the dead to life with such magicks, would they truly be as they once were, thoughts, memories, and feelings intact? The Grand Sers believe they can regain their youth, and perhaps they can─but the dead who have passed into Halone’s halls cannot return. They cannot. Yet Gigi still resolves to attempt the resurrection of Archmagus Quan. Cyr adds that Sharlayan texts in the archives describe Quan as a renowned scholar of ancient Allagan magicks, reinforcing the link to Gigi’s abilities, and notes that he has even learned the location of the archmagus’s former home. Perhaps something there might help persuade Gigi to abandon this dangerous course. He intended to summon Hildibrand and travel there together, and he asks if you will join them. You agree─but before plans can be made, a quavering voice interrupts, calling him “heretic.”</p>
<p>A faint-hearted inquisitor stammers that he saw everything: Inquisitor Cyr sneaking into the archives, seeking out forbidden tomes, eyes gleaming with a “mad light” as he read their proscribed knowledge. Cyr protests that it was all for his investigation, only for the man to seize on the admission as a confession of crime. In the name of the Supreme Sacred Tribunal, he moves to denounce Cyr for secretly reading forbidden texts without permission, in violation of inquisition rules. Something inside Cyr snaps. He calls the man stupid and ignorant, then demands to know if everyone is so desperate to keep their godsdamned posts that they will accuse anyone and everyone of heresy. Is this what the inquisition has become? He shouts that he is sick of peering into every shadow for imagined heretics, of trying to guess the hidden sins of everyone he meets. It is stupid, pointless, and beneath them. The flustered inquisitor threatens to inform his superiors if Cyr will not surrender himself, then flees. Once he is gone, Cyr exhales and realizes that everything inside him has just come spilling out. There is no point pretending he has no personal stake in this any longer─or that his work here still resembles a “proper” inquisition. Somewhere along the way he stopped hunting the guilty and began searching instead for the truth─and for ways to help those in need. But there is no place in the inquisition for men like that, and it is only a matter of time before the stuttering fool returns with guards. Cyr decides they must leave for Idyllshire at once and find the inspector.</p>
<p>In Idyllshire, Nashu confirms what Cyr feared: the inspector has already gone off on his own. She explains that the Grand Sers briefly returned to trade “jinglyshine” for supplies, loudly discussing plans to go and kill dragons in the forelands. When Hildibrand heard this, he insisted he had to pursue them immediately and take Gigi back. This time, he said, it was his duty not as an inspector, but as a father. Julyan has no patience for such sentiment. She snarls that he has no obligations to a mammet─especially one that walked away of its own free will─and curses that the moment she turns her back on her boy, he loses his mind. Nashu worries that the inspector will do something reckless and begs that they go after him to lend a hand. Cyr is more concerned with what might happen if the Grand Sers truly attempt to slay a great wyrm and harm Hraesvelgr’s brood, but he agrees on priorities: first, they must locate Hildibrand. He asks you to assist Nashu and Julyan in searching for the inspector while he himself visits Archmagus Quan’s abandoned residence, hoping to find something that might save Gigi. Anticipating objections, he insists you need not worry about his safety─your shared ordeals have inured him to the harsher side of reality. Julyan eyes him and wonders aloud if the scrawny little wretch has finally found his spine. Following Nashu’s lead, you travel to Tailfeather in the Dravanian forelands, where she suggests splitting up to ask the locals about a trio of elderly Ishgardian dragonslayers, a mammet, and a strange inspector. The hunters and traders recall the group clearly: bold as brass, the “veterans” boasted that they were off to slay the greatest dragon of them all. Few believed such claims, but they remember the direction well enough. The trio, along with Gigi, were headed toward Anyx Trine, intent on glory. With this information, Nashu realizes the Grand Sers’ destination, Julyan notes that Hildibrand could not be far behind, and together you set off toward the higher reaches of Avalonia.</p>
<p>In Avalonia Fallen, Nashu spots a familiar figure quite literally lodged in the ground. The unfortunate soul, who bears a striking resemblance to Orland, is embedded headfirst in the earth. Nashu comments that the inspector certainly gave this one a sound thrashing, while Julyan wonders what became of the others─and of the mammet. Nashu proposes pulling the poor man free and asking him directly, then realizes it may not be so simple and turns to you with a cheer, declaring that you surely have the strength to haul him out. With a mighty effort, you wrench the figure from the soil. Julyan eyes the man’s legs and muses that the firm thighs and buttocks look awfully familiar. Once the dust settles, Nashu points out that he is wearing some sort of magicked mask that makes him look just like the inspector, reminiscent of a certain “man of a thousand faces” from Ul’dah. Julyan, however, will not be fooled: this is Hildibrand himself, and no disguise can deceive a mother. Before anyone can argue, a booming yet genial voice asks what trouble his beloved son has gotten himself into this time. Lord Godbert arrives with Cyr at his side. Nashu greets them both and asks how they ended up traveling together. Cyr explains that he was too far from Tailfeather when night fell, but by blind fortune Lord Godbert happened upon him wandering in the wilds. Godbert says Lord Edmont briefed him on the recent Grand Sers affair and Hildibrand’s involvement, and as a father he could not help but take an interest in his son’s predicament. Cyr adds that he was eager to share his latest discovery: Archmagus Quan’s research notes. At that moment, Hildibrand stirs, stretches, and notes he has not slept so soundly since the time he was buried in the lichyard. He confesses his embarrassment at being discovered in such an undignified state, having been so unceremoniously disposed of by the Grand Sers, but expresses heartfelt gratitude for the rescue and delight at being reunited with everyone. Julyan immediately scolds him, saying this never would have happened if he had waited for them, then demands to know why he is still wearing that ridiculous getup. Hildibrand insists that an impenetrable disguise is essential when dealing with criminal elements, though he admits that the Grand Sers have grown more perceptive with their newfound youth.</p>
<p>Cyr seizes on that phrase at once and demands clarification. Have they truly regained their youth? What of Gigi─did Hildibrand see him, and was he behaving strangely? Hildibrand pauses and recalls that Gigi’s warm, soulful eyes looked rather more “pointy” than he remembered. Cyr pales and calls upon Halone. According to Archmagus Quan’s notes, sharper, pointier eyes are a clear sign that Gigi is overusing his magic. If he continues like this, his aether will be drained, and he will become nothing more than an empty husk. Hildibrand is horrified by the revelation, declaring that they must catch up to the Grand Sers at once. Cyr asks if he knows where they were headed; the only thing Cyr heard was that they wanted to slay dragons. Hildibrand answers that they were bound for the Churning Mists, to a place called Zenith, intending to kill a great wyrm named Nidhogg─then stops short as the implications sink in. After an awkward beat, he clears his throat and corrects himself, saying he meant the other great wyrm, Hraesvelgr. Cyr cries out in dismay at the very idea and demands to know what they could possibly hope to achieve by challenging such a being, as the dire race to save Gigi and avert disaster enters its next stage.</p>

<p>シルはあなたに密かに声をかけ、これまでになく深刻な面持ちで語り始める。前回別れてから今日まで、彼は異端審問所の書庫をくまなく調べ上げ、「時間魔法」に関する記述を探し続けてきたのだという。その結果は、少なくとも安心できるものではなかった。</p>
<p>聖典『エンサイクロペディオン』において、古代アラグは驕りと傲慢ゆえに滅びた戒めの象徴として描かれている。だが一方で、外典とされる文書の中には、アラグ人をむしろ同情的に、あるいは称えるように描くものも少なからず存在していた。そうした文書の中に、かつてアラグの魔道士が操った「時間魔法」への言及が見つかったのである。そこには、特定の対象の「時間的な状態」を停めたり、逆行させたりできる術が記されていた。もしこれらの記述が真実であり、ギギが見せた力が同じ系譜のものであるならば、大公の花瓶を元どおりにしたのと同じように、グランドセールにも時間を巻き戻すことができるのかもしれない。しかし、生きた存在は壺とは違う。シルは、割れた壺の中に水が入っていた場合を想像してほしいと告げる。壺が元の形に戻ったとして、その中の水はどうなるのか。割れる前と同じように水が満たされるのか、まったく別の水なのか、それとも一度こぼれた水は二度と戻らないのか。彼はそれを「魂」にたとえる。仮に時間魔法で死者の肉体を動かすことができたとしても、その者は本当にかつてのままなのか。記憶も思考も感情も、すべて同じだと言えるのか。グランドセールたちは失われた若さを取り戻せると信じている。実際にそうなる可能性もあるだろう。だが、ハルオーネの御許へと旅立った死者が戻ってくることはない。決してありえないのだ。それでもギギは、アークマギス・クァンを蘇らせようと決意している。さらにシルは、書庫にあったシャーレアンの文献によって、アークマギス・クァンが古代アラグ魔法の研究で名を馳せた学者であったことも判明したと語る。ギギの力が古い系譜に連なるものである証拠だと言えるだろう。そして、かつてクァンが暮らしていた住居の場所も突き止めた、と。そこへ向かえば、ギギの進む道を変えさせる手がかりが見つかるかもしれない。ヒルディブランドを呼び出し、あなたと三人で向かうつもりだったと話し、彼は同行を求める。あなたが頷いたそのとき、震える声が割り込んだ。「異端者だ」と、彼を指差す影が現れる。</p>
<p>姿を現したのは、気の弱そうな若い審問官だった。彼はシルに向かって「異端だ」と震える声で繰り返し叫ぶ。自分はこの目で見たのだ、と。シル審問官がこっそり書庫に忍び込み、禁書の在りかを探り、あの「禁じられた知識」にむさぼりつく狂気じみた眼差しを──と。シルは慌てて、それはすべて捜査のためにやむなく行ったことだと弁解するが、その言葉はかえって「無断で禁書を読んだ」という告白として受け取られてしまう。若い審問官はこれ幸いとばかりに、最高聖座より委ねられた権限において彼を断罪すると宣言しようとする。そこで、シルの中で張り詰めていたものがぷつりと切れた。彼は相手を愚かで無知だと罵り、皆がそんなにも必死に地位にしがみつきたいがために、誰彼かまわず異端呼ばわりするようになってしまったのかと問いただす。これが今の異端審問所の姿なのか──と。彼は声を荒げ、自分はもう、あらゆる影の中に「異端者」を見いだそうとすることにうんざりしているのだと吐き出す。出会う者すべての「秘めた罪」を探ろうとするのは愚かで、無意味で、本来の自分たちが目指すべき姿からはかけ離れているのだと。うろたえた審問官は、「自首しないのなら上官に報告するしかない」と言い残して慌てて去っていく。静けさが戻ると、シルは肩の力を抜き、自分の胸の内がすべて口からこぼれ落ちてしまったことを悟る。もはや、この件に「個人的な思い入れ」がないふりをしたり、自分はいまだ職務に忠実な異端審問官だと言い聞かせたりすることはできない。いつからか彼は、罪人探しではなく「真実」と「助けを求める者たちの救い」を求めるようになっていた。だが、そうした人間に異端審問所で居場所はない。そして先ほどの審問官が護衛を連れて戻ってくるのも時間の問題だろう。だからこそ、今すぐイディルシャイアへ向かい、ヒルディブランドを捜さねばならないのだと彼は決意する。</p>
<p>イディルシャイアに到着すると、ナシュはすぐに彼の不安が的中していたことを教えてくれた。すでにヒルディブランドはひとりで飛び出し、グランドセールと対峙するために出て行ってしまったのだという。ナシュの話によれば、グランドセールたちは一度イディルシャイアに戻り、光るガラクタを「チャリンチャリン」と鳴る貨幣に替えて物資を買い込んでいったらしい。その際、ドラヴァニアの辺境でドラゴンを討つ計画を大声で話していたと、ゴブリンたちが耳にしたのだそうだ。後になってその話を聞いたヒルディブランドは、「父親としての務め」を果たすため、一刻も早く後を追い、ギギを連れ戻さねばならないと言い残して旅立った。今度は「探偵」としてではなく、「父」としての責任を果たすのだと。ジュリアンはそんな言葉に鼻で笑う。あの子にはマメットに対して義理立てする必要などない、とりわけ自分の意思で出て行った人形に対してなど──そう言い捨て、「ちょっと目を離した隙に息子が正気を失った」と悪態をつく。ナシュはヒルディブランドが無茶をしないか心配だと言い、皆で後を追い、手を貸すべきではないかと訴える。シルはむしろ、グランドセールが本当に竜に挑み、フレースヴェルグの眷属を傷つけることのほうが重大だと懸念していたが、まずはヒルディブランドの所在を突き止めるのが先決だと判断する。彼は、ナシュとジュリアンが行う捜索をあなたに手伝ってほしいと頼み、自分はそのあいだにアークマギス・クァンの廃屋を訪ね、有用な手がかりを探すつもりだと告げる。そして、あなたが彼の身を案じるより先に、「これまで共に経験してきた数々の出来事のおかげで、現実の厳しさにはだいぶ慣れた」と冗談めかして笑い、自分の安全を気にする必要はないと言ってみせる。ジュリアンはそんな彼を見て、「やせっぽちの小僧にもようやく背骨が生えたのかね」と半ば感心したように呟く。ナシュの提案で、一行はまずドラヴァニアの高地にあるテイルフェザーへ向かい、そこで別々に人々へ聞き込みをすることにした。ナシュは「イシュガルドの老練な竜騎士三人組と、小さなマメット、それからとびきりの名探偵を見なかった？」と尋ねて回る。狩人や商人たちは、その奇妙な一行をはっきりと覚えていた。彼らは大声で「最も偉大な竜を討ち倒してみせる」と豪語し、武勲と栄光を並べ立てていたが、その実力を本気で信じる者はほとんどいなかった。それでも、どちらの方角へ向かったかはよく覚えている。三人とマメットは、アニクス・トライン方面へ向かっていったというのだ。この情報を持ち寄ったとき、ナシュはグランドセールたちの目的地を理解し、ジュリアンも「ヒルディもそう遠くにはいないだろう」と見当をつける。そして一行は、アヴァロニア・フォールンの奥へと足を進めていくのだった。</p>
<p>アヴァロニア・フォールンに入ると、ナシュはすぐに妙な光景を見つける。まるでオーランドそっくりの男が、逆さまのまま地面に突き刺さったような格好で、しっかりと埋まっていたのだ。哀れな魂は土に飲み込まれたかのように動かず、その姿はどう見てもただ事ではない。ナシュは「見てください、インスペクターが彼に一泡吹かせたに違いありません！」と感心し、ジュリアンは「そうかもしれないけど、残りの二人とマメットはどこへ行ったんだい」と眉をひそめる。ナシュは「とりあえず引っこ抜いて話を聞きましょう」と提案するが、実際にやるとなると簡単ではなさそうだと気づき、あなたに視線を向ける。あなたならきっと引き抜ける、と信じ切った目で。あなたが力いっぱい引き上げると、男はどうにか地面から抜け出し、土ぼこりがぱらぱらと落ちる。ジュリアンはその脚と尻をしげしげと眺め、「あの引き締まった太ももと尻は、どうにも見覚えがあるね」と呟く。やがてナシュは、男が何やら魔法の仮面をつけていることに気づく。その仮面は、顔立ちをヒルディブランドそっくりに見せるもので、ウルダハで見かけた「千の顔を持つ男」を思い出させる。しかしジュリアンは一笑に付す。「あれは間違いなくヒルディブランド本人さ。母親の目はごまかせないよ」と言い切るのだ。そのとき、朗らかな声が響き、「やれやれ、今度はどんな騒ぎに巻き込まれているのかね、我が息子は」と問いかける。振り向けば、ロード・ゴッドベルトがシルを伴って姿を現していた。ナシュは二人に挨拶し、どうして一緒に旅をしているのか尋ねる。シルは、日が暮れたとき自分がテイルフェザーからかなり離れた場所にいたのだが、幸運にも荒野を彷徨っているところをロード・ゴッドベルトに拾われたのだと説明する。ゴッドベルトは、ロード・エドモントからグランドセール騒動の顛末と、そこにヒルディブランドが関わっていることを聞かされていたと言い、「父親として息子の身に起きていることに無関心ではいられない」と微笑む。シルは自分もまた、アークマギス・クァンの研究ノートという新たな発見を伝えるべくここまで同行したのだと続ける。ちょうどそのとき、地面から引き抜かれたヒルディブランドが目を覚まし、大きく伸びをして「墓地に埋められて以来、これほどよく眠ったのは久しぶりだ」と言う。グランドセールにあっさりと投げ捨てられた挙句、このような姿で発見されたことには少なからず恥ずかしさを覚えると打ち明けつつも、救いの手を差し伸べてくれたこと、そしてこうして皆と再会できたことには心から感謝していると告げる。ジュリアンはすかさず、「ひとりで突っ走らず私たちを待っていればこんな目には遭わなかっただろうに」とたしなめ、そのうえで「それに、なんでまだそんなガラクタ変装を着込んでるんだい」と呆れたように問いただす。ヒルディブランドは真顔で、犯罪者たちと渡り合うには見破られない変装が不可欠なのだと答え、しかし「彼らも若さを取り戻したことで目が肥えてきたようだ」と苦笑するのだった。</p>
<p>その「若さを取り戻した」という言葉に、シルはすぐさま反応する。本当に彼らは若返ってしまったのか。ギギはどうなったのか。様子がおかしかったりしなかったかと矢継ぎ早に問いただす。ヒルディブランドは少し考え、「そういえばギギのあの温かく澄んだ瞳が、以前よりいくぶん『とがって』見えた気がする」と答える。その瞬間、シルはフューリーの名を呼んで青ざめる。アークマギス・クァンの研究によれば、瞳が鋭く尖ったように見えるのは、ギギが魔力を使いすぎている明確な兆候なのだという。このまま力を振るい続ければ、彼のエーテルは使い果たされ、魂の抜けた空っぽの器になってしまう危険がある。ヒルディブランドはこの知らせに愕然とし、すぐさまグランドセールたちを追いかけなければならないと声を上げる。シルは、彼らがどこへ向かっていたのかを尋ねる。自分の耳に入ってきたのは「竜を狩る」という話だけだったからだ。ヒルディブランドは、彼らがクルザスの上空に広がるチョコボの霧海──ではなく、ドラヴァニア雲海のゼニスへ向かい、「ニーズヘッグという名の大いなる竜」を討ち取るつもりだと言いかけて、はっと我に返る。短い沈黙のあと、彼は咳払いをして、「いや、違った。もう一体のほうだ、フレースヴェルグだ」と慌てて言い直す。シルは「フレースヴェルグだと！？」と叫び、フューリーにすがるような思いで頭を抱える。彼らはいったい何を成し遂げようとしているのか──そう嘆きつつも、一行はギギの命と偉大な竜を守るため、急ぎその後を追う覚悟を固めるのだった。</p>

<p>Cyr 請你單獨聊聊，臉上的陰影比以往更重。自從上次分別後，他一直在 Inquisition 的書庫裡翻找所有關於 temporal magicks 的記錄，而結果讓他感到十分不安。《Enchiridion》中把古代 Allag 描寫成一個警世故事──一個因虛榮與傲慢而自取滅亡的帝國。然而，在某些被視為外典的文獻裡，Allag 人卻被描寫得比較值得同情，甚至接近被「歌頌」的對象。正是在這些邊緣文本中，他找到關於古代 Allagan mage 所操縱的時間魔法的描述：可以「暫停」或甚至「逆轉」某個物體時間狀態的 magicks。如果這些記錄屬實，而 Gigi 展現出的能力也是同一系統，那麼他或許真的能像修復大公的花瓶那樣，替 Grand Sers 把時間的指針往回撥。不過，living being 和花瓶畢竟不同。Cyr 要你想像花瓶碎裂時裡面裝滿了水：就算時間倒流讓器皿恢復原狀，裡面的水又會怎麼樣？會像之前一樣重新被填滿嗎？那些水會和原來的一模一樣、每一滴都回來，還是變成另一批不同的水？或者，一旦灑出的水就永遠消失了？他說，自己其實是在談「靈魂」。就算有人能用這種 magicks 讓 dead 之人再度站起來，他們真的還是之前的那個人嗎？記憶、思想、感情是否都還完完整整？Grand Sers 深信自己可以奪回 lost youth，也許真的做得到，但踏入 Halone 殿堂的死者，是不可能回來的，「不可能」。即便如此，Gigi 還是決定要試著 resurrect Archmagus Quan。Cyr 補充，書庫中的 Sharlayan 文本提到，Archmagus Quan 本人就是研究 ancient Allagan magicks 的著名學者，這更加印證了 Gigi 的能力與古代傳統之間的關聯。他也已經調查出這位 archmagus 以前的 residence 所在位置，也許那裡能找到說服 Gigi 回頭的線索。他原本打算把 Hildibrand 叫來，和你一起三人同行，於是先問你是否願意同行。你答應後，還來不及細談，一個顫抖的聲音便突然插入對話，叫他「Heretic」。</p>
<p>一名怯懦的審問官結結巴巴地指著 Cyr，說自己親眼看見──看到他偷偷溜進書庫尋找 forbidden tomes，看見他眼中閃爍著「瘋狂的光芒」，貪婪地閱讀那些被禁止的 knowledge。Cyr 連忙辯解，說自己只是為了調查而做這些事，結果對方立刻抓住這句話，當作他承認自己有罪：在未經許可的情況下，私自閱讀禁書，明顯違反 Inquisition 規章。於是他開始搬出 Supreme Sacred Tribunal 的權威，打算以此名義控訴他。Cyr 心裡某根弦就此崩斷。他怒斥對方愚蠢、無知，質問所有人是不是都為了保住那該死的職位，才會對誰都隨便扣上 heresy 的帽子，Inquisition 現在竟然淪落到這種地步嗎？他大聲喊出自己已經受夠了，受夠在每一處陰影中找出「異端者」，受夠對每一個遇到的人都去猜測他們藏在心中的「罪」。那既愚蠢、又毫無意義，而且和他們應有的樣子完全不符。受到嚇唬的審問官放話說，如果 Cyr 不願自首，他就只好回去報告上級，然後匆匆跑走。四周安靜下來後，Cyr 才意識到自己心裡的一切已經全講了出來。到這個地步，他再也無法假裝自己對這件事「毫無個人情感」，也無法再說服自己正以「審問官」的身份專心辦案。某個時間點開始，他不再只是想找出 guilty，而是開始追尋 truth，並尋找能幫助有需要之人的方法。只是，這樣的人在 Inquisition 裡並沒有位置。更何況，那個口吃的傢伙帶著武裝護衛回來也只是時間問題。於是 Cyr 下定決心，他們必須立刻前往 Idyllshire，找到 Inspector。</p>
<p>抵達 Idyllshire 之後，Nashu 很快就證實了他的擔憂。Inspector Hildibrand 已經先一步獨自出發，打算去對峙 Grand Sers。她說，那三個人曾經短暫回來，用「jinglyshine」跟 gobbie 交換物資，還大剌剌地談論要去 forelands 獵龍的事。等 Inspector 後來得知這段 gossip 時，就說自己必須立刻追上去，把 Gigi 搶回來。這次他要履行的 duty，不是 Inspector 的職責，而是 father 的義務。Julyan 對此完全沒有興趣，只是冷冷地說，他根本沒有對一個 mammet 履行責任的必要──尤其是那個 mammet 之前還是自己選擇離開的。她咒罵自己才一轉眼沒看好兒子，他就整個人瘋掉。Nashu 則擔心 Inspector 會做出 reckless 的舉動，央求大家趕快追上去幫忙。Cyr 更在意的是，一旦 Grand Sers 真的試圖攻擊 dragon，甚至傷害到 Hraesvelgr 的 brood，可能會引發無法挽回的後果。不過，他還是先排好優先順序：第一步是找到 Hildibrand。於是他請你協助 Nashu 和 Julyan 一起尋人，自己則打算先去 Archmagus Quan 的廢棄 residence 看看，說不定那裡會有和 Gigi 有關的線索。他也預先打消你的顧慮，說你不必為他的安全擔心──那些共同經歷早已讓他習慣現實世界的殘酷。Julyan 看著他，半帶揶揄地猜測，也許這個瘦巴巴的小鬼終於長出 backbone 了。在 Nashu 的帶領下，你們前往 Dravanian Forelands 附近的 Chocobo Forest，然後再前往 Tailfeather，並約定分頭打聽消息。Nashu 問起「三名 Ishgard 老竜殺手加上一個 mammet，可能還被一位非凡的 Inspector 追著跑」的奇怪組合。當地獵人與居民對這群人印象深刻：他們高談闊論自己要去殺掉「最強的一條龍」，滿口 glory 和 kill 的誇耀，但真正相信他們實力的人幾乎沒有。不過，對方往哪個方向走，大家倒是記得很清楚──那一行人連同 Gigi，一路朝 Anyx Trine 的方向去了。當你們把情報彙整起來時，Nashu 立刻推敲出 Grand Sers 的目的地，Julyan 也認為 Inspector 不可能離他們太遠。於是，一行人朝著 Avalonia 的高處前進。</p>
<p>來到 Avalonia Fallen，Nashu 很快就發現了「Grand Sers 的其中一人」。一名看起來和 Orland 十分相似的不幸傢伙，整個人像被硬生生釘入地裡一般，牢牢卡在土中。系統提示也明白指出，這個可憐的靈魂已經被深深埋進地面。Nashu 看了大呼不可思議，說 Inspector 肯定給了對方一個深刻的教訓。Julyan 則注意到，另外兩個人與那個 mammet 依然不見蹤影。Nashu 提議把這人先挖出來問清楚，說完又意識到實際動手恐怕不太容易，於是轉頭請求你出力，說你一定有足夠的力氣把他整個拉出來。你用盡全力一拽，總算把那個人從地底拔了出來。塵土落定後，Julyan 盯著那雙腿和臀部，喃喃說那雙 firm thighs 與 buttocks 看起來實在是太眼熟了。這時 Nashu 發現，他臉上戴著某種 magicked mask，讓他看起來就像 Inspector，一如 Ul’dah 那個「man of a thousand faces」所使用的把戲。不過 Julyan 完全不被蒙騙，她斷言那就是 Hildibrand 本人──母親的眼睛不會看錯。還來不及多說，一個洪亮而溫和的聲音響起，問自己心愛的兒子這次又惹上了什麼麻煩。Lord Godbert 和 Cyr 一同現身。Nashu 熱情地打招呼，問他們為什麼會一起同行。Cyr 說，夜色降臨時他人還在離 Tailfeather 很遠的地方，恰好在 wilderness 迷路之際，被路過的 Lord Godbert 撿到。Godbert 則表示，Lord Edmont 已經把最近牽涉到 Grand Sers 的麻煩，以及 Hildibrand 的調查過程一五一十告訴他，身為父親，自然不可能對兒子的處境漠不關心。Cyr 補充說，他也正好想傳達自己的最新發現──那就是 Archmagus Quan 的研究筆記。就在此時，被拔出地面的 Hildibrand 慢慢甦醒，伸了個懶腰，說自己自從被埋在 lichyard 之後，就沒睡得這麼香過。他坦言自己被 Grand Sers 一腳踢開，又以這種姿態被發現，實在有點丟臉，但仍對大家伸出援手心懷感激，也很開心能再次與眾人重逢。Julyan 毫不留情地責備他，如果當初願意等大家一起行動，就不會發生這種事，接著又質問為什麼到現在還戴著那堆垃圾變裝。Hildibrand 認真地回答，和 criminal elements 打交道時，impenetrable 的 disguise 是不可或缺的，只是看來 Grand Sers 在重獲青春之後，眼力也跟著變好了。</p>
<p>一聽到「newfound youth」這幾個字，Cyr 立刻追問。Grand Sers 真的已經恢復年輕了嗎？Gigi 呢？你有沒有見到他，他有沒有什麼奇怪的舉動？Hildibrand 想了想，說起來 Gigi 那雙原本溫暖又充滿神采的雙眼，看起來似乎比以前「更尖銳」了一些。Cyr 聽了大為震驚，脫口而出 Fury 的名號。根據 Archmagus Quan 的筆記，眼神變得尖銳銳利，正是 Gigi 過度使用魔法的明顯徵兆。如果再這樣下去，他的 aether 會被完全耗盡，最後只會變成一具空空如也的 husk。Hildibrand 對這個消息感到無比震驚，立刻表示必須馬上追上 Grand Sers。Cyr 問他是否知道對方的目的地，因為他聽到的只有「要去 slay dragons」這樣的說法。Hildibrand 回答說，對方打算前往 Churning Mists 的一處名為 Zenith 的地方，要去討伐名為 Nidhogg 的 great wyrm──話說到一半，他忽然意識到哪裡不對。稍作停頓後，他乾咳一聲，改口說自己指的是「另一個」偉大龍族──Hraesvelgr。Cyr 聽罷忍不住大叫：「Hraesvelgr！？Fury 在上，他們到底指望做到什麼？」充滿危機感的質問在空中迴盪，而你們追趕 Grand Sers、拯救 Gigi 並避免最壞結局的行動，也在這一刻邁入新的階段。</p>
