    story:<div class="clamp" data-collapsed="true">
<p>Rammbroes calls you over at once, his expression heavy with news that cannot wait. The situation has grown worse for everyone—worse for Unei, Doga, and Nero, still imprisoned beyond the rift. G’raha Tia has you recall your last venture into Syrcus Tower: the Calamity awakened Emperor Xande, and you laid him to rest for good, yet his binding covenant with the Cloud of Darkness remained. Even as Unei and Doga tried to annul it, the entity reached through a breach and dragged them—and Nero—into the dark realm.</p>
<p>Since then, the fellowship of NOAH has pursued every lead to bring them back, only to uncover a more dire truth: the Crystal Tower still obeys Xande’s orders, gathering energy to open another voidgate even now, the air around it seeming to hum with power. They have tried everything to halt the imperial edict, but the tower will heed only those with Allagan royal blood—just as it once opened only for Unei and Doga. G’raha adds that Nero’s tomestone spoke of an ancient Allagan means to bestow royal blood upon others—technology without which Amon and his underlings could never have controlled the tower.</p>
<p>Rammbroes cannot hide what that means for the present: they possess neither that lost art nor anyone of royal blood, and every moment of delay risks a vast rift through which the Cloud of Darkness could enter your realm. Even if the covenant were broken, the energy amassed within the Crystal Tower could discharge unchecked, unleashing a calamity like the one that destroyed Allag. Their world, not merely three lost comrades, now hangs in the balance—so they commit to a desperate answer: use Syrcus Tower’s power to create a portal into the dark realm, rescue those who can control the tower from the far side, and seal the rift after them.</p>
<p>They have sought counsel from a thaumaturge versed in otherworldly matters, and with Cid working to make the portal a reality, the final preparations are underway. Cid arrives with urgency and confidence, reporting the device nearly ready despite the difficulty of fastening it to Syrcus Tower, and insisting it will generate the energy they need with only a little more fine-tuning. He asks you to come to the tower at once—Biggs and Wedge will guide you from the Eight Sentinels—and with a wry edge, he reminds you not to miss another chance to save the world.</p>
<p>At the Eight Sentinels, Biggs confirms the plan and admits his worry: opening the voidgate is one thing, but passing through a rift—and returning—is something he has never heard of anyone doing. Wedge, half thrilled and half terrified, tells you the tower is full of engineers making constant adjustments, because a single misaligned coupling could mean disaster. He sends you upward to where Cid oversees the operation, and when you arrive, Cid waits for the signal—then pauses, staring at Emperor Xande’s throne, imagining what might have been if Allagan civilization had endured under a just ruler instead of ambition.</p>
<p>G’raha answers that there were those who tried to stop Xande. He speaks of young and brave warriors who rose against Allag’s dominion and became beacons of hope to the suffering, much like the Warriors of Light in your own age—yet their push only hastened the end. Cornered and enraged, Xande sought to open a great rift to hasten the Cloud of Darkness’s coming, and commanded the sun’s power held within Dalamud be emptied into Syrcus Tower at once. The consequences were catastrophic: the tower survived only by flooding the land below with energy, and Syrcus was swallowed by the earth—an account that leaves Cid admitting he knew the cause of the Fourth Umbral Calamity, but not that rebellion had driven Xande to such rashness.</p>
<p>When Biggs gives the word, the machine begins to channel power into the tower, and a rift to the World of Darkness yawns open. Rammbroes praises Cid’s work, but Cid cuts off any celebration—this gate is unstable, it will not remain open forever, and only a few can pass through it. He stays behind to keep it open, as do the Sons of Saint Coinach, leaving you with the burden of leading the adventurers beyond the breach toward the Cloud of Darkness and your three trapped comrades, knowing that returning will be no small feat and that you must be fully prepared before you go.</p>
<p>Before you step through, G’raha asks for a moment and speaks of the crimson eye he bears—a trait of Allagan royalty—and the questions it has awakened in him. The more he learns of the Crystal Tower, the less he feels like himself; meeting Unei and Doga has changed something deep within, stirring a relentless urge to remember something ancient and vital. His father’s words echo in his mind—that the truth of their eye rests with Allag—and he admits he must learn what history has hidden, and see this journey through with his own eyes. He implores you to take him with you beyond the rift, and with your assent, he pledges himself to the venture into the World of Darkness to save your comrades and your realm.</p>
<p>In the dark realm, G’raha calls out desperately for Unei, Doga, and Nero—and Nero answers with sharp irritation, alive but battered. Unei lies unconscious, and Doga explains that Nero’s wounds ran too deep, letting this foul place invade his body as darkness claws at the aether of his very form. Xande’s covenant bound the Cloud of Darkness to bring prosperity to Allagan royalty, and that same blood offers them only a measure of protection; it does not shield them from other voidsent, and the Cloud has kept them here to unleash fiends upon them—survival owed to Nero’s defense, not to mercy. Then the Cloud of Darkness addresses you through the Echo, declaring herself eternal in her realm and vowing to smother your light and entomb your bones in shadow.</p>
<p>Doga admits what that means: as long as you fight the Cloud here, you may be unable to destroy her—but this may be your one chance to stop her, by striking while she can barely hold her form and severing Xande’s covenant. Unei wakes enough to agree, swearing to raze the bridge between the Crystal Tower and this place once and for all, and urges you and G’raha to flee. G’raha recoils at the thought of leaving them behind—no one but them can save the world from the Crystal Tower—yet the Cloud snarls at a new realization: your blood, and G’raha’s, carries protection born of Xande’s blood.</p>
<p>Unei names the truth aloud: G’raha possesses royal blood, and that is why the Royal Eye runs in his line—why he has the authority to command the Crystal Tower. Doga believes this cannot be coincidence; someone must have planted this gift in G’raha’s lineage using the highest Allagan technology. Even if the tower will not recognize him as Allagan as he is now, his Royal Eye speaks a simple truth—within him is a faint glitter that can illuminate all, the light of hope—and Unei and Doga offer their last gift: they will share their blood with him, briefly bolstering the Allagan presence within so he can take control and seal the tower’s threat away.</p>
<p>They tell Nero to leave as well, and Unei returns the instrument he dropped while defending them, warning him that what he seeks may not be possible but urging him not to give up, for other paths still await. You and G’raha refuse to forget their sacrifice, and you turn to run as the Cloud tries to bar your escape. A glint of light appears, then begins to fade—the covenant’s annulment weakening the bridge between realms—and with it, the chance to return. Nero rages and resists, refusing to be carried, spitting defiance as he declares his name and ambition, but in the chaos Cid dives in and forces the escape—leaving Nero snarling at the debt he never wanted to owe.</p>
<p>Back in Mor Dhona, Rammbroes thanks the gods you return unharmed, while Biggs and Wedge confess how helpless they felt as the voidgate began to close—and then falter when Unei and Doga are not with you. Rammbroes grieves them, yet accepts they fulfilled their purpose, and the grim problem remains: without someone who can command the Crystal Tower, sealing it would be impossible. G’raha answers that it is possible—Unei and Doga entrusted him with their blood, and he can now control the tower—though exhaustion forces him to ask for rest before the final act, for you and Nero have only just emerged from hard battle.</p>
<p>Later, as you prepare to regroup, G’raha tells you that no one but you could have succeeded in the World of Darkness, and admits he was little more than a vessel for Unei and Doga’s blood. Yet something has returned to him: witnessing true bravery and gaining royal blood has stirred a memory of his forebears’ dearest wish—a wish hidden for millennia and brought to light by the people of NOAH. He will not speak of it now, only asks you to go on ahead while he attends to something small, thanking you as a comrade he could not have wished better for, even as fate demands he play a different role. And when you gather again at Saint Coinach’s Find, Cid thanks you for bringing Nero back alive, the others mourn Unei and Doga as the ones you knew and lost, and Rammbroes urges you to rest—then return, so the specter of the Allagans can finally be dispelled for good.</p>

<p>ラムブロースはあなたを呼び止め、すぐに知るべき報せがあると告げる。その内容は希望とは程遠く、闇の世界に囚われたウネ、ドーガ、そしてネロにとっても同じだ。グ・ラハ・ティアは、あなたにシルクスの塔での前回の出来事を思い起こさせる。災厄が長い眠りを破り、皇帝ザンデは目覚めたが、あなたは彼を永遠に眠らせた。だが彼は「暗闇の雲」と恐るべき契約を結んでおり、ウネとドーガがそれを無効化しようとした矢先、裂け目から伸びた力が彼らとネロを引きずり込み、闇の世界へ連れ去ったのだ。</p>
<p>その日以来、ノア調査隊は裂け目の向こうにいる三人を救い出すために動き続けてきた。だが調査の果てに判明したのは、さらに深刻な問題だった。クリスタルタワーは今なお皇帝ザンデの命令に従い続け、ヴォイドゲートを再び開くためのエネルギーを収束している。塔は、まるで力の奔流を内側に抱え込み、周囲が震えるほどの気配を放っているという。どれほど手を尽くしても帝命は止められず、かつてウネとドーガにしか扉が開かなかったのと同じく、塔が従うのはアラグ王家の血を引く者だけだった。</p>
<p>グ・ラハは、ネロが持ち込んだアラグのトームストーンに触れ、黄金期の王家には自らの血を他者へ授ける術があったらしいと語る。その技術がなければ、アモンや配下がクリスタルタワーを支配することなど不可能だったはずだ。だが今の彼らにその術はなく、王家の血を引く者もいない。時間が経てば経つほど、暗闇の雲が現世へ侵入できるほどの巨大な裂け目が開く危険が増す。契約を断てたとしても、抑えの利かぬ塔の力が暴走すれば、アラグを滅ぼした災厄に等しい事態を招きかねない。守るべきは三人の仲間だけではなく、世界そのものなのだ。</p>
<p>唯一の活路として彼らが選んだのは、シルクスの塔の力を逆用し、闇の世界へ通じる門をこちらから開くことだった。裂け目の向こうで塔を制御できる者を救い出し、その者たちが戻った直後に裂け目を封じる。異界に通じる術に通じた呪術士ギルドの人物から可能性を聞き、ガーロンドが門を開く装置を仕上げつつあるという。そこへ当のガーロンドが現れ、装置はほぼ完成しており、シルクスの塔へ取り付けるのにガーロンド・アイアンワークスの知恵を絞り尽くしたが、必要な力は得られると胸を張る。八人の衛士にはビッグスとウェッジを案内として残すから、すぐに塔へ来てほしいと、あなたに急ぐよう促した。</p>
<p>八人の衛士でビッグスは計画を確認しつつ、裂け目を開くこと自体が大事業だと語る一方、その先に不安を漏らす。裂け目を越えて戻ってきた者など聞いたことがなく、自分たちまで帰れなくなるのは御免だというのだ。ウェッジは興奮を隠しきれないが、塔では技師たちが走り回り、結合部品ひとつのズレが大爆発につながるほどの力を扱っていると顔をこわばらせる。それでも準備は整いつつあり、あなたは上へ向かい、作戦の最終段階を見届けることになる。</p>
<p>玉座の前で待つガーロンドは、信号を待ちながら皇帝ザンデの玉座を見つめ、アラグの技術と権勢の象徴が今は空虚な椅子に過ぎないと嘆く。もしアラグ文明が存続し、正しき皇帝が座していたなら、歴史はどう変わり、どれほど先へ進めただろうか――だが野望の前には止めようがなかった。グ・ラハは、止めようとした者がいたことを語り始める。皇帝ザンデの覇道は人々を傷つけ、若く勇敢な戦士たちは剣を取り、苦しむ者の希望の灯火となった。それは現代の光の戦士たちに似ていたが、結果は破滅を早めただけだった。追い詰められた皇帝は怒りと焦りから、暗闇の雲の降臨を早めるために巨大な裂け目を開こうとし、ダラガブに蓄えられた太陽の力をシルクスの塔へ注ぎ込めと命じた。塔は大地へ力を溢れさせることで辛うじて耐え、シルクスは地中へ呑まれた――それが第四霊災の引き金だった。</p>
<p>やがてビッグスの合図が届き、装置が稼働し始める。膨大な力が塔へ流れ込み、闇の世界へ通じるヴォイドゲートが口を開く。ラムブロースは成果を讃えるが、ガーロンドは喜ぶのはまだ早いと釘を刺す。ゲートは安定せず、永遠には開き続けられず、通れる者も限られる。彼はここに残って開口を維持し、サンクト・コイナック財団もまた同じく残るという。そしてあなたには、裂け目の向こうへ冒険者たちを率いて進む役目が託される。待つのは暗闇の雲と、囚われた仲間たち――戻ることさえ容易ではないから、出発前に万全を整えよと念を押される。</p>
<p>出発の直前、グ・ラハはあなたに時間を求め、自らの眼について語る。あの紅い眼はアラグ王家にのみ見られる徴であり、なぜ自分に受け継がれたのか、長く考え続けてきたという。クリスタルタワーを知れば知るほど自分が自分でなくなり、ウネとドーガという二人の存在に出会ってから、記憶の底で何かが強く蠢き始めた。古く、しかし何より大切な何かを思い出さねばならないという渇きが止まらない。父の言葉――その眼の真実はアラグにある――が頭から離れず、歴史が隠した真実を知り、旅の終わりまで自分の両眼で見届けたいと告げる。そして彼は懇願する。裂け目の向こうへ行くあなたに同行させてほしい、と。</p>
<p>闇の世界に踏み込むと、グ・ラハは仲間たちの名を叫ぶ。耳障りだと吐き捨てるような声が返り、ネロが生きていることがわかる。ウネは気を失い、ドーガはネロの傷が深く、この場所の闇が彼の身体へ入り込み、形そのもののエーテルを蝕んでいると説明する。皇帝ザンデの契約はアラグ王家に繁栄をもたらすもので、その血が彼らにわずかな保護を与えているが、他のヴォイドセントには通じない。暗闇の雲は彼らを閉じ込め、魔物を放って殺そうとしたが、ネロが必死に守り抜いたのだ。そこへ暗闇の雲がエコーを通じて告げる。ここでは自分は永遠であり、あなたの光を覆い尽くし、骨を影の中に葬る、と。</p>
<p>ドーガは、ここで暗闇の雲と戦う限り、滅ぼすことはできないかもしれないと認める。だが形を保つのがやっとの今なら、皇帝ザンデの契約を断ち切れる可能性がある。ウネも同意し、クリスタルタワーとこの忌まわしい場所をつなぐ橋を、今度こそ完全に焼き払うと誓う。あなたとグ・ラハに逃げろと促し、二人はここに残る覚悟を示す。グ・ラハは愕然とするが、暗闇の雲はあなたたちの血に気づく。皇帝ザンデの血がもたらす保護を、あなたたちも得ているのかと。</p>
<p>ウネは真実を突きつける。グ・ラハは王家の血を宿し、それゆえ「王家の眼」がその一族に現れるのだと。彼はクリスタルタワーに対する権限を授けられている。ドーガは、現代に王家の血が残るのは偶然ではなく、誰かが最高位のアラグ技術を用いてその贈り物を血筋に植え付けたのだろうと推測する。塔が今の彼をアラグと認めないとしても、王家の眼が示す事実は揺るがない――彼の内には、すべてを照らす希望の光のきらめきがある。ウネとドーガは、その力を引き出すために自分たちの血を分け与えると告げる。効果は一時的でも、彼の中のアラグの存在を強め、塔を制御する助けになるはずだ。</p>
<p>ネロにも去れと促し、ウネは防戦の最中に落とした道具を返し、望む結果が得られなくとも諦めるなと告げる。あなたとグ・ラハは二人に感謝を誓い、ここを離れようとするが、暗闇の雲は逃がすまいと迫る。希望の光が一瞬きらめき、そして薄れていく。契約が断たれ、世界をつなぐ橋が脆くなっているのだ。光が消えれば帰還は叶わない。ネロは抵抗し、死ぬなら自分で決めると叫び、自らの名と野望を叩きつけるが、混乱の中でガーロンドが裂け目へ飛び込み、強引に帰還を成立させる。ネロは悪態をつきながらも、前へ進まざるを得なくなる。</p>
<p>モードゥナに戻ると、ラムブロースはあなたたちが無事であることに安堵し、ビッグスとウェッジはゲートが閉じかけた瞬間の無力さを語る。だがウネとドーガがいないことを知り、言葉を失う。ラムブロースは二人を悼みながらも、その目的を果たしたのだと受け止める。しかし問題は残る。クリスタルタワーを封じる者がいないという現実だ。そこでグ・ラハは告げる。ウネとドーガが血を託してくれたから、自分が塔を制御できる、と。とはいえあなたもネロも疲弊しており、まずは休息が必要だと頼む。</p>
<p>やがてグ・ラハはあなたに、闇の世界で成し遂げたのはあなた以外にいないと告げ、裂け目の向こうでは自分は血の器に過ぎなかったと悔しさを滲ませる。それでも彼は、王家の血を得て真の勇気を目撃したことで、祖先の切なる願いを思い出したと言う。ノア調査隊の人々が掘り起こした、幾千年に埋もれていた願い――今こそ、それを実現する時が来たのだと。詳しくは後にすると言い、あなたには先にサンクト・コイナックの探索地へ向かってほしいと頼む。そこでガーロンドは、ネロが生きて戻れたのはあなたのおかげだと感謝し、仲間たちはウネとドーガを悼み、ラムブロースはあなたに休めと告げた上で、クリスタルタワーの脅威を完全に払い去る決意を固める。</p>

<p>Rammbroes 一見到你就直截了當地說明情勢：你必須知道最新的消息，而這些消息對你們並不友善，更對被囚在黑暗界域的 Unei、Doga，以及 Nero 沒有半點好兆頭。G’raha Tia 要你回想上一次踏入 Syrcus Tower 的經歷——災厄讓沉睡的機關蘇醒，也讓 Emperor Xande 再度現身；你親手讓他永遠安息。然而，Emperor Xande 與 Cloud of Darkness 之間那份可怕的契約仍在延伸影響。Unei 與 Doga 正努力想將契約作廢時，裂縫中伸出的力量卻把他們——連同 Nero——一併拖離你們的世界。</p>
<p>自那一天起，NOAH 就把一切心力都押在「救回 Unei、Doga、Nero」這件事上，但調查帶回的結論更令人心驚：Crystal Tower 仍在依照 Emperor Xande 的命令運作，持續聚集能量，準備再次開啟新的 voidgate，甚至彷彿能聽見塔身被力量撐滿時的低鳴。你們已經用盡方法想阻止那道帝命，卻無計可施——就像過去只有 Unei 與 Doga 能讓機關回應一樣，現在 Crystal Tower 也只會聽從擁有 Allag（古代亞拉戈帝國）王家血脈的人。</p>
<p>G’raha Tia 提到 Nero 交給你們的 Allagan（古代亞拉戈帝國）石板：在 Allag（古代亞拉戈帝國）的黃金時代，王族似乎曾掌握把「王家之血」賦予他人的技術；若沒有那種手段，Amon 與他的黨羽根本不可能掌控 Crystal Tower。可惜你們手上既沒有那門技術，也沒有任何擁有王家血脈的人。Rammbroes 只能把最壞的結果攤開來：每多等一刻，就多一分讓 Cloud of Darkness 穿越巨大裂縫、降臨你們世界的風險。就算能斬斷契約，Crystal Tower 內堆積的能量若無法被壓制，也可能像當年毀滅 Allag（古代亞拉戈帝國）那樣暴走，釀成同等規模的災難——你們要擔心的早已不只三位失散的同伴，而是整個世界。</p>
<p>你們唯一的賭注，是反過來利用 Syrcus Tower 的力量：在塔內創造通往黑暗界域的 portal，救回能夠控制 Crystal Tower 的人，並在他們回來後立刻封住裂縫。據說這件事可行，是因為有一位精通異界之理的 Thaumaturges’ Guild 成員提供了判斷，而 Master Garlond 正帶著 Ironworks 把裝置趕工到最後階段。Cid 也在此時現身，語氣乾脆，說裝置幾乎完成——把那個麻煩東西固定在 Syrcus Tower 上，已經榨乾 Ironworks 所有人的巧思，但它應該能產生你們需要的能量。只要再做些微調，就能打開裂縫；他要你立刻前往 Crystal Tower，並說 Biggs 與 Wedge 會在 The Eight Sentinels 等你帶路。</p>
<p>在 The Eight Sentinels，Biggs 一邊確認計畫，一邊忍不住坦白擔憂：能開啟 voidgate 已經是壯舉，可「穿越裂縫又回來」更像是從未有人證實的事，他實在不想你們也被困在那裡。Wedge 則又興奮又緊張，告訴你 Syrcus Tower 裡到處都是工程師在調整，因為你們正在處理極端龐大的力量，只要某個接點偏了一點點……就可能爆炸。他嘴上說應該沒事，卻仍催你到上方去，Cid 正在那裡坐鎮，等最後的訊號。</p>
<p>你抵達後，Cid 望著 Emperor Xande 的 throne，像是在替 Allag（古代亞拉戈帝國）的榮耀與墜落做一場無聲的整理：那曾是技術與權勢的象徵，如今只剩一把空椅。他忍不住想像——若 Allagan（古代亞拉戈帝國）文明延續至今，若有一位正直的皇帝仍坐其上，歷史會不會完全不同？G’raha Tia 接過話，說曾有人試圖阻止 Emperor Xande：他的征服讓所有人都付出代價，年輕而勇敢的戰士挺身而出，成為受苦者眼中的希望燈塔，像你們這個時代的 Warriors of Light 一樣。然而，這份抵抗反而加速了毀滅——當他們逼近 Allag（古代亞拉戈帝国）的核心，Emperor Xande 在憤怒與絕望中下令，把 Dalamud 裡的「太陽之力」一次灌入 Syrcus Tower，想強行打開巨大的裂縫、迎來 Cloud of Darkness。結果是可怕的：塔為了撐住衝擊，把能量傾瀉到下方大地，Syrcus 就此被吞入地底，而那正是 Fourth Umbral Calamity 的成因。</p>
<p>訊號終於傳來，裝置啟動，龐大的能量被導入塔中，闇黑的裂縫在你們眼前張開——通往 World of Darkness 的門出現了。Rammbroes 讚嘆這成果，Cid 卻立刻提醒：現在還不能鬆一口氣，因為 voidgate 不穩定，無法長時間維持，而且能通行的人數有限。他決定留在原地確保裂縫不會立刻閉合，Sons of Saint Coinach 也同樣留下。Rammbroes 於是把最沉的責任交到你手上：你必須帶領冒險者穿越裂縫，去面對 Cloud of Darkness，並尋回你們失散的三位同伴；而一旦踏入那一側，想回來絕不容易，所以你必須確認自己已準備周全。</p>
<p>就在你即將出發前，G’raha Tia 把你叫住，說他想談談自己的「眼」。那抹血紅色的瞳色，只在 Allag（古代亞拉戈帝國）王族之間出現；他一直在想，自己為何會繼承這樣的特徵。越接近 Crystal Tower，他越覺得自己像被什麼牽引，尤其在遇見 Unei 與 Doga 之後，他的內心被強迫去追尋某段古老卻極其重要的記憶。父親的話也不斷在他腦中回響：關於這隻眼的真相，答案在 Allag（古代亞拉戈帝國）。他說自己必須把真相看清楚——把你們的旅途走到最後——所以他請求你，讓他與你一同踏入 World of Darkness。</p>
<p>你們在 World of Darkness 終於找到回應——Nero 的聲音尖銳又暴躁，顯然活著，卻也受了重傷。Unei 昏迷不醒，Doga 沉聲說明：Nero 的傷口太深，讓這個污穢之地趁虛而入，黑暗正在撕扯他形體本身的 aether。Emperor Xande 的契約把 Cloud of Darkness 束縛在「替 Allag（古代亞拉戈帝國）王族帶來繁榮」這個誓約之上，那份血脈也給了你們「有限度的保護」；但那保護無法對抗其他 voidsent，而 Cloud of Darkness 正是要把你們囚在此處，再放出群魔將你們撕碎——你們之所以還活著，是因為 Nero 撐著身體把你們護了下來。接著，Cloud of Darkness 透過 Echo 向你們宣告：在她的領域中，她是永恆的；她要熄滅你們的光，把你們的骨骸埋進她的陰影。</p>
<p>Doga 低聲承認，在這個領域裡，你們或許無法真正消滅 Cloud of Darkness；但正因為她此刻難以維持形體，這反而可能是切斷契約的唯一機會。Unei 也在搖晃中醒轉，立刻接上：必須把 Crystal Tower 與這個地方之間的橋樑徹底摧毀，永遠斬斷連結——並催促你與 G’raha Tia 立刻撤離。G’raha Tia 震驚地反對，說只有 Unei 與 Doga 能拯救世界、阻止 Crystal Tower 的威脅；然而 Cloud of Darkness 卻在怒意中察覺你們的血——她看出你們也得到了 Emperor Xande 血脈所帶來的防護。</p>
<p>Unei 於是把真相說得再明白不過：G’raha Tia 身上有 Allag（古代亞拉戈帝國）王家血脈，這就是 Royal Eye 會出現在他血統中的原因——他也因此被賦予了掌控 Crystal Tower 的權限。Doga 認為這絕不可能是巧合：必定有人用最高等的 Allagan（古代亞拉戈帝国）技術，把這份「禮物」植入他的家族血脈中。即便 Crystal Tower 不會把現在的他視為 Allag（古代亞拉戈帝国）之人，Royal Eye 仍指向同一個事實——他體內有一點微弱卻真實的光，足以照亮一切，是「希望之光」。Unei 與 Doga 決定把自己的血分給他，哪怕效果只是短暫，也能強化他體內的 Allagan（古代亞拉戈帝国）痕跡，讓他得以掌控塔，完成他必須完成的事。</p>
<p>他們也要 Nero 離開。Unei 把 Nero 在防守時掉落的器具還給他，坦白說那器具未必能帶來他想要的結果，但也要他別放棄，因為前方仍有其他道路可走。你與 G’raha Tia 向他們承諾絕不忘記，並轉身突圍；Cloud of Darkness 立刻追逼，想把你們留在此地。就在那一瞬間，你看見一道微光閃現，又迅速黯淡——契約被切斷後，兩界之橋也開始崩解；若那光徹底熄滅，你們就會永遠困在這裡。Nero 在怒吼中拒絕撤退，說要死也要按自己的意志去死，並把自己的名字與野心狠狠丟向你們；但混亂之中，Cid 為了把你們拉回來，竟直接衝進裂縫，把你們逼回歸途——Nero 只能一邊咒罵、一邊硬撐著往前。</p>
<p>回到 Mor Dhona，Rammbroes 看到你們平安歸來，立刻鬆了一口氣；Biggs 與 Wedge 也承認，裂縫開始閉合的那一刻，他們從未感到如此無力——然而當他們發現 Unei 與 Doga 沒有跟著回來，所有人的聲音都卡住了。Rammbroes 沉痛地說，他會想念那兩人，但也替他們完成使命而感到欣慰；隨之而來的現實卻仍沉重——沒有能控制 Crystal Tower 的人，就無法將它封印。G’raha Tia 於是回應：這點不再成立，因為 Unei 與 Doga 已把血託付給他，他現在能控制 Crystal Tower 了。只是他也坦白自己疲憊到骨子裡，你與 Nero 也才剛結束漫長戰鬥，所以請求先休息片刻，再去完成最後的封印。</p>
<p>之後，G’raha Tia 對你說，能在 World of Darkness 成功的只有你；而他在裂縫彼端所做的，多半只是承載 Unei 與 Doga 的血。他沒有把話說得太多，只承認自己確實想起了一些事——得到王家之血、親眼看見真正的勇氣，喚回了祖先最珍視的願望。那願望沉埋千年，卻被 NOAH 的人們重新帶回光中；而他也終於到了該讓它實現的時刻。他請你先前往 Saint Coinach’s Find，說自己還有件小事要做才會跟上。當你們再次會合時，Cid 感謝你讓 Nero 活著回來，其他人仍為 Unei 與 Doga 的離去而難過，而 Rammbroes 則要你先好好休息——然後，和他們一起把 Allag（古代亞拉戈帝國）的陰影從你們的世界徹底驅散。</p>
