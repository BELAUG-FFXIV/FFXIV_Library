      <p>In the Hall of Flames, Raubahn bids you listen well, warning that what he is about to say will take some time. He shows you the letters he has prepared for his counterparts in the Eorzean Alliance and speaks of the battle at Carteneau—how five years ago he could do nothing but watch as comrades were torn from him, first by the Garlean Empire and then by the primal brought forth through their treachery. Not a day passes, he confesses, that he does not think of those who fell, nor of the Warriors of Light, who vanished without a trace. The tragedies of the Calamity are not easily forgotten, nor should they be, for in remembering what was lost, the people are reminded of what they still have. For this reason, he intends to mark the fifth anniversary of the Battle of Carteneau with a memorial service in honor of the fallen, and he hopes the other city–states will do the same. He asks you to bear his words to the leaders of Limsa Lominsa and Gridania as his personal envoy, explaining that your deeds make you the closest thing he has to a Warrior of Light and that he can think of no one more worthy of the task. Once you accept, he grants you leave to travel as his official representative and, unwilling to wait while you walk across half the realm, authorizes you to use the airship routes linking the three nations. He places in your hand a pass that proves this privilege, noting that such travel is no longer open to all because of the constant threat of imperial attack and that these passes are granted only when circumstances demand it—though in your case, there were those who argued you should receive one regardless. Your potential is plain to all who have eyes to see, he says, but that is enough talk. In the name of the sultana, he bids you go forth, see with your own eyes the realm that the Warriors of Light gave everything to defend, rise to your calling, and answer the Crystal’s summons. If man or beast stands in your way, you are to strike fast and true, for victory belongs to the bold; and if you ever lose your way, you are to heed the Crystal’s guidance and move on.</p>
      <p>Back at the Quicksand, Momodi all but pounces on you the moment you return, eager to know what Raubahn said. When she learns you have been named the Flame General’s personal envoy and charged with carrying his message to the leaders of the Alliance—and that you will be doing it by airship—she can scarcely contain her amazement, declaring it an honor and a half and insisting she cannot think of anyone who deserves it more. She tells you that most folk live and die without ever seeing Eorzea from above, never knowing the blues of Limsa Lominsa’s seas or the many greens of Gridania’s forests, but you will see all that and more, meeting fascinating people with stories of their own wherever you go. She urges you to savor every encounter and every journey, for they are truly priceless, but also reminds you that troubles are not confined to Ul’dah and that you will find your share of danger in the other city–states. In truth, she suspects that is exactly what Raubahn wants you to realize, because he knows what kind of man you are—the sort who cannot resist sticking his nose into other people’s problems, and she tells you never to change. With a final wish for your safety, she sends you on your way. At the airship landing, Elyenora of Highwind Skyways greets you by name as the Flame General’s envoy and offers you passage to Limsa Lominsa. Once your reservation is made, the attendants call passengers to the gate, and as the airship prepares to depart, Nanamo, Momodi, and others see you off from afar, offering silent hopes and spoken blessings that your journey will carry you ever in the light of the Crystal.</p>
      <p>During the journey, your perspective shifts once more, the Echo carrying you far from the quiet cabin of the airship to the steel ramparts of Castrum Occidens in Eastern La Noscea. There, Gaius van Baelsar gazes out over the ruins and remembers another battlefield. Fifteen years have passed, he says, yet the bitter taste of defeat remains: he recalls the imperial fleet bound for Mor Dhona, led by the flagship Agrius, and their certainty that all of Eorzea would soon fall before them once Silvertear Lake was taken. Instead, they were met by an unnumbered host of dragons, at whose heart flew Midgardsormr himself. Though the Empire struck down that lord among wyrms, the cost was the loss of the Agrius and with it all hope of victory; thus did their vaunted conquest end. Looking upon the realm, Gaius calls Eorzea a blighted land riddled with false gods, twice escaped from the Empire’s grasp—even Meteor, the so–called Great Sin, failed to bring it to heel, and in that failure the realm has only sunk deeper into corruption. Yet, he asserts, it must be “saved,” and only Garlean rule can impose the order needed to deliver its people from ignorance. As work continues around him and announcements echo through the castrum, two engineers whisper about rumors of another campaign, wondering if the legatus truly means to strike again despite the Emperor’s supposed reluctance; their doubts are cut short when Nero tol Scaeva arrives. With polite menace, he questions them, exposes one as a spy by codename, and dismisses the man’s protests before having him executed on the spot, reminding the survivors that the Frumentarium sees all. As the body is dragged away and the other engineer scrambles to obey, Nero turns his thoughts to Cid Garlond, vowing that Garlond will soon know the true strength of magitek.</p>
      <p>When the Echo leaves you, you find yourself disembarking in Limsa Lominsa, where the arrivals attendant recognizes you as the envoy from Ul’dah and informs you that the Admiral awaits. A Storm honor guard welcomes you more formally, remarking that the Admiral has been looking forward to your coming and directing you toward the Crow’s Lift, which will carry you down to Bulwark Hall. There, Zanthael greets you at the entrance and, with a soldier’s caution, asks to examine the seal on the Flame General’s missive. Once he has confirmed that everything is in order, he apologizes for the formality, explaining that they cannot afford carelessness, and invites you onward. In the command room upon the Bridge, Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn bids you enter, observing with a wry note that the “silver–tongued merchants” of Ul’dah have seen fit to send an adventurer to speak for them and that they must place no small faith in you. She introduces herself as Admiral of Limsa Lominsa and commander of the Maelstrom, then asks for news from Thanalan and, before you begin, requests your name. When you give it, she frowns slightly, saying that she could have sworn she knew you, but that it seems she was mistaken; though she sometimes forgets old friends’ faces, she never forgets her enemies, and any Admiral who did would be in grave trouble. With that half–jest behind her, she invites you to deliver Raubahn’s message. After she has heard the proposal for a remembrance service, she falls briefly silent, struck by the realization that five years have already passed since the Empire last tried to wrench Eorzea from their hands. She recalls how, in answer to that threat, the city–states reformed their Grand Companies and renewed the Eorzean Alliance, only for Garlemald to escalate the conflict with the Meteor project, under Legatus Nael van Darnus. She speaks of how they marched to Carteneau to stop Dalamud’s fall, battled the VIIth Legion with everything they had, and yet could not prevent Dalamud’s shell from breaking and Bahamut emerging—a dragon vast enough to dwarf cities, bent on turning the realm into an eighth hell. In the space of a few breaths, the imperial legions were consumed by fire, and their own armies fared little better; words, she says, can scarcely describe the sight.</p>
      <p>Even so, by some miracle, a few survived. Merlwyb tells you how, just as she steeled herself for death, a blinding white light enveloped her, stole her senses, and when she awoke, Bahamut was gone and the land itself lay twisted and scorched beyond recognition. Were Archon Louisoix still among the living, he might explain what truly happened, but he is not, and she fears they will miss his wisdom in the days ahead. As their nations struggle to recover from the Calamity’s devastation, the beast tribes continue to summon their primals, whose very existence is a blight on the land, and each city–state is too beset by its own primal woes to look much beyond its borders. Yet the Empire still presses close, she warns; Garlemald has not renounced its claim on Eorzea, and imperial forces crowd the frontiers, waiting for a chance to strike. They need champions to take the place of those they lost, but brooding on that need will change nothing. Time is short, and no savior will come from elsewhere—those who survived must work together for the good of all. A memorial service may be just what is needed to remind the people of the unity they once shared, and so she declares that Raubahn has the right of it and that she accepts his proposal, promising to see to the necessary preparations in Limsa Lominsa and to send her reply directly to Ul’dah. Your duty here complete, she asks you to carry her regards to the Elder Seedseer in Gridania and adds, with a faint, private smile, that you should also tell her “the wolf has been sniffing around the stables,” a jest in poor taste perhaps, but one she wishes you to repeat exactly. With that, she bids you farewell and entrusts your journey to the Navigator’s guidance.</p>
      <p>Your return to the sky is swift. Highwind Skyways’ staff arrange your passage onward, and you board another airship—this time bound for Gridania. Upon your arrival in the Black Shroud, the Gridanian arrivals attendant greets you as the envoy from Ul’dah and informs you that the Elder Seedseer awaits. A Serpent honor guard confirms your identity and instructs you to proceed into the city and present yourself to the conjurer at Nophica’s Altar, who will admit you to the Lotus Stand. The Silent Conjurer there respectfully asks to see the seal on the Flame General’s letter, confirms that it is genuine, and leads you into the heart of Gridania’s sacred grove. At the Lotus Stand, Kan–E–Senna welcomes you in the name of her nation, introduces herself as Elder Seedseer and leader of the Order of the Twin Adder, and acknowledges that you bear a message from Raubahn. Before hearing it, however, she asks if she may look more closely at your face. After a moment of quiet study, she apologizes, explaining that you remind her of someone she once knew—a brave and noble soul—and then gently steers the conversation back to the business at hand. When she has heard Raubahn’s wish to hold a remembrance service for those who fell at Carteneau, she asks what you know of Eorzea’s struggle with the Empire and, satisfied that others have already recounted much of the tale, decides to speak instead of what lies ahead. You also share Merlwyb’s message, the jest about a wolf at the stables, and Kan–E–Senna accepts it with a small, knowing smile before turning to the greater threat.</p>
      <p>She explains that for most of its history, Garlemald was not even counted among the more influential nations of Ilsabard, until breakthroughs in magitek some fifty years ago lifted it out of obscurity. Empowered by this new technology, the Empire swiftly subjugated its neighbors, expanding until all of Ilsabard lay within its grasp, and then set its sights on Eorzea. Its rise, however, was not due to magitek alone, but also to the leadership of its first and still–reigning emperor, Solus zos Galvus, a man who forged an empire in a single lifetime. Now, after more than fourscore winters, he is said to be frail and oft ill, and rumors that disputes over the succession have unsettled the imperial court may explain why Garlemald has been comparatively quiet in recent years, giving the city–states time to rebuild. Yet they cannot allow themselves to grow complacent, for the XIVth Imperial Legion still occupies Eorzean soil under the command of Gaius van Baelsar, whose ambitions are infamous. So long as he breathes Eorzean air, she says, none can truly sleep easy. The Calamity wrought such ruin that the nations have struggled merely to tend their wounds, let alone restore their defenses, and they do not have the strength to repel the Empire outright. To make matters worse, each is besieged by primals summoned by the beast tribes, whose very presence exhausts the land and consumes precious aether. Every city–state is so occupied with its own problems that none have the luxury of looking far beyond their own borders. Against this backdrop, Merlwyb’s “wolf” clearly signifies renewed imperial activity, and Kan–E–Senna interprets it as a warning that Garlemald may soon move again. Though the primals pose a grave danger, she judges the Garlean threat greater still and insists that the time has come for the peoples of Eorzea once more to think and act as one. A storm is gathering, she says, and if they are to weather it, they must stand united. A memorial service may be just what is needed to rekindle that spirit of unity, and she tells you that the Flame General was wise to make his proposal. She will see that a similar service is arranged in Gridania and will send her reply to him at once. With your duty as envoy now fulfilled, she thanks you for coming so far and bids the Twelve guide you safely home.</p>

      <p>ウルダハのナル回廊にある「不滅隊本部」で、ラウバーン・アルディンは「よく聞け」と前置きしてから、長くなる話だと断ったうえで語り始める。彼は、エオルゼア同盟の盟友たち宛てにしたためた書簡を見せつつ、五年前のカルテノー平原の戦いを思い起こす。あのとき、自分たちは何もできず、まずはガレマール帝国軍に、次いで奴らの奸計によって呼び出された蛮神に、大勢の仲間たちを奪われていく様を見ているしかなかった──そうして倒れた戦友たちのことも、戦いののちに姿を消した「光の戦士たち」のことも、ラウバーンは今なお一日たりとも忘れたことがないと言う。第七霊災の悲劇は決して容易く忘れ去られるものではなく、また忘れてはならない。何を失ったのかを覚えているからこそ、自分たちに何が残されているのかを思い出すことができるのだと、彼は静かに続ける。だからこそ彼は、カルテノーの戦いから五年の節目を迎えるにあたり、戦没者を慰霊する式典を開く決意を固めており、他国にも同様の追悼を呼びかけるつもりでいる。その意図を伝える使者として、自分の言葉をエオルゼアの盟主たちに届けてほしい──そう頼んだうえで、この役を託す理由を語る。数々の武勲を挙げてきた君こそ、今の自分にとって「光の戦士」に最も近い存在であり、それにふさわしい者はほかにいないと。君が快諾すると、ラウバーンは正式にウルダハの使者として任命し、グリダニアとリムサ・ロミンサへの旅路を託す。もっとも、徒歩での移動を待つほど暇でも辛抱強くもいられないと苦笑した彼は、三都市間を結ぶ飛空艇航路の利用を認め、その特権を証明する通行証を手渡す。帝国の襲撃という絶え間ない脅威にさらされる今、飛空艇は誰もが気軽に乗れるものではなく、こうして事情がある者にのみ渡されるものだと説明しつつ、君の場合は、それでもなお発行すべきだと主張した者たちがいたのだと付け加える。君の秘めたる可能性は、自分ひとりだけが見抜いたものではない──そう告げたあとで、彼は言葉を切り、もう十分話したとばかりに表情を引き締める。そして、「砂の都の女王」の名において旅立ちを命じると、光の戦士たちがすべてを懸けて守ったこの大地を自らの目で見てくるように、クリスタルに選ばれた者として己の使命を果たすようにと、力強く送り出す。もしも行く手を人や魔物が阻むなら、ためらわずに打ち倒せ──勝利は、果敢なる者のものだ。そして、もし道に迷いそうになったときは、クリスタルの導きに従え、と。</p>
      <p>その後、「クイックサンド」に戻ると、モモディが待ち構えていたかのように駆け寄り、ラウバーンから何を言い渡されたのかと身を乗り出す。君が不滅隊盟主の「親書」を預かる使者に任命され、エオルゼア同盟の盟主たちに言葉を届ける役目を負ったこと、しかもそれを飛空艇で果たすことになったと聞くと、彼女は目を丸くして驚き、それはもう大した栄誉だと声を上げる。だが、誰よりもその栄誉にふさわしいのはあなただと断言し、心から誇りに思うと笑顔で告げるのだった。彼女は、今や飛空艇に乗れる者はごく限られており、ほとんどの人々は一生を終えるまで、一度も空からエオルゼアを眺めることなく冥土へ旅立っていくのだと語る。リムサ・ロミンサの海の青さも、グリダニアを包む森の数えきれないほどの緑も知らぬままに……しかし、君はそうではない。これから訪れる先々で、さまざまな景色を目にし、さまざまな人々と出会い、それぞれの物語に触れるだろうから、そのひとつひとつを大切に味わってほしい──それらはすべて、何ものにも代え難い宝物なのだと教えてくれる。そのうえで、外の世界にも危険は満ちているのだから、くれぐれも無茶はしないようにと念を押す。リムサやグリダニアが直面している問題を、身をもって知ってほしいというのも、きっとラウバーンの狙いなのだろうと、彼女は推し量る。君がどんな人間なのか──つまり、人の厄介ごとを見つけたら、放っておけない性分だということを、彼はよく知っているはずだと笑い、そんな君のままでいてほしいと背中を押す。最後に「気をつけて行っておいで」と見送りの言葉をかけられたあと、君はナル回廊の飛空艇乗り場へ向かう。ハイウインド飛空社の受付嬢エレノラは、君が不滅隊盟主の使者であると承知しており、リムサ・ロミンサ行きの搭乗手続きを手際よく進めてくれる。やがて乗客への案内が響き、飛空艇が離陸のときを迎えるころ、スルタナやモモディたちはそれぞれの場所から君の旅立ちに思いを馳せ、「クリスタルの加護があらんことを」と心の内で祈りつつ、空へと舞い上がる船影を見送るのだった。</p>
      <p>飛行のさなか、君の意識は再び「エコー」によって引き寄せられ、静かな船内から遠く離れたラノシアの「カストルム・オクシデンス」へと移る。そこでは、ガイウス・ヴァン・バエサルが要塞の高みから荒れ果てた地平を見渡し、十五年前の戦場を回想していた。モードゥナのシルバーテア湖へ向けて進軍したあの日、最強の旗艦「アグリウス」を筆頭とする帝国艦隊は、湖を押さえればエオルゼアはすべて掌中に落ちると信じ、勝利を疑わなかった。だが実際に彼らを迎え撃ったのは、数えきれぬほどのドラゴンたちであり、その中心には龍の王たるミドガルズオルムがいた。帝国軍は激戦の末にその龍王を討ち果たしたものの、その代償として無敵を誇った旗艦アグリウスを失い、勝利への望みも同時に潰えたのだと、彼は悔しげに語る。かくして帝国の栄光ある征服は終わりを迎え、エオルゼアは二度にわたってガレマールの手をすり抜けてきた。ガイウスの目には、エオルゼアは「偽りの神々」に蝕まれた荒廃した地であり、メテオ計劃という「大罪」をもってしても支配すること叶わず、その失敗によって、むしろ堕落と混乱を深めているように映っている。それでもなお、この地は「救われねばならない」のだと彼は断じ、秩序をもたらして民草を無知から解放できるのは、ガレマールの支配だけだと信じて疑わない。その背後では、魔導兵器の点検を知らせる構内放送が響き、ふたりの技師が、レガトゥスが本当に再びエオルゼア侵攻を企てているのかと囁き合う。しかし、そのささやきは、ネロ・トル・スカエウァの登場によって突然断ち切られる。彼は柔らかな口調で出身地を問いただし、ひとりを「コードネーム・ハミングウェイ」と呼んで密偵であることを暴くと、否定の言葉も最後まで言わせずに、フルメンタリウムがすべてを見通しているのだと告げたうえで、容赦なく始末してしまう。残された技師に遺体の処理を命じ、その場を支配する沈黙の中で、彼は「ガーロンドよ、まもなく真の魔導の力を思い知らせてやる」と、シド・ガーロンドへの執着を滲ませるのだった。</p>
      <p>エコーの光が薄れると同時に、君は再び自分自身の身体に戻り、今度はリムサ・ロミンサの飛空艇発着場で船を降りる。到着ロビーでは、案内役の係員がウルダハからの使者である君を歓迎し、提督メルウィブ・ブルーフィスウィンが到着を待ちわびていると伝える。黒渦団の名誉護衛兵も、ウルダハの使者に敬意を表しつつ出迎え、「クラウズリフト」に乗ってバルワークホールへ向かうよう案内する。そこで出迎えるザンサエルは、まず不滅隊盟主の書簡に押された封蝋を確かめさせてほしいと丁寧に願い出る。封印が正規のものであることを確認すると、警戒を解いた彼は、決して油断できない情勢であることを詫びの言葉とともに説明し、橋上の指揮所へと案内する。艦橋に設けられた指令室で、メルウィブは「入れ」と短く告げ、君を迎え入れる。彼女はまず、ウルダハの「口の巧みな商人たち」が使者として冒険者を寄越してきたことに言及し、それだけ君を信頼しているのだろうと皮肉混じりに評する。続いて自らをリムサ・ロミンサの提督にして黒渦団総帥と名乗り、ザナラーンからどのような知らせを携えてきたのかと尋ねるが、その前に君の名を知りたいと目を細める。名乗りを聞いた彼女は、一瞬、どこかで会った覚えがあるような気がすると眉をひそめるが、すぐに首を振って「気のせいだろう」と笑い飛ばす。古き友の顔を忘れることはあっても、敵の顔を忘れるようでは提督失格だ、と冗談めかしたあとで、改めてラウバーンの親書を読み上げるのだった。カルテノーの戦いから五年の節目に、戦没者を慰霊する式典を開く──そうした提案に目を通した彼女は、思わず「七つの地獄よ……もう五年も経つのか」と、時の流れの速さに驚きを漏らす。そして、ガレマール帝国がエオルゼアを奪おうと牙を剥いたあの頃を振り返り、帝国の脅威に対抗するべく、各都市国家がグランドカンパニーを再編し、エオルゼア同盟を再び結成したことを語る。しかし、ガレマールは単なる軍事力の衝突だけでは決着をつけようとせず、「メテオ計劃」と呼ばれる暴挙に出た。第VII軍団長ネール・ヴァン・ダーナスは、小月ダラガブを天より引き寄せ、この地を「浄化」するという狂気じみた計畫を押し進めたのであり、それを阻止するために、自分たちはカルテノー平原へと軍勢を進め、帝国軍と死闘を繰り広げたのだと。</p>
      <p>メルウィブは、多くの戦場を見てきた自分でさえ、カルテノーの戦いほど苛烈な戦いは他に知らないと言い切る。ありとあらゆる手を尽くし、一歩も退かぬ覚悟で戦ったにもかかわらず、その努力ではダラガブの殻を破って現れた翼ある悪夢──都市ひとつ分はあろうかという巨体の「蛮神バハムート」が、エオルゼアを八番目の地獄に変えようとするのを止められなかった。帝国軍は瞬く間に炎に包まれて壊滅し、自軍もまたほとんど焼き尽くされてしまった。あのときは、世界そのものが燃え上がっているかのようだったと振り返り、あの光景を言葉で語り尽くすことなどできないと苦々しく呟く。それでもなお、奇跡的に生き残った者たちがいることもまた事実だった。メルウィブ自身も、死を覚悟した瞬間、眩い白光に包まれて意識を失い、気がついたときにはバハムートの姿は消え、あたり一面には、焼け焦げて歪み果てた大地が広がっていたという。もし今もなお賢者ルイゾワが存命であれば、この計り知れぬ出来事の理を少しは教えてくれただろうが、彼はもういない。霊災の爪痕が癒えきらぬなか、蛮族たちは相変わらず蛮神を呼び出し、その存在そのものが大地を蝕み続けている。どの国も、自国の蛮神問題に手一杯で、とても他国の心配にまで手を伸ばせる状況ではないというのが現実だ。だが、帝国がエオルゼアを諦めたわけではないことも、彼女は重々承知している。ガレマールは今も国境地帯に軍勢を展開し、機をうかがっている。失った戦力を補う新たな英雄が必要だと嘆いていても、時間は待ってはくれない。誰かが現れて救ってくれるのを待つのではなく、第七霊災を生き延びたひとりひとりが、エオルゼアのために力を合わせねばならないのだ──そう強く言い切ったうえで、彼女は慰霊祭の提案が、人々にかつての結束を思い出させるきっかけになるかもしれないと評価する。ラウバーンの考えはもっともだと認め、リムサ・ロミンサでも同様の式を執り行うと約束し、不滅隊盟主への返書は自ら手配すると告げる。君のリムサでの役目はこれにて果たされたとしつつ、次の目的地グリダニアのカヌ・エ・センナへよろしく伝えてほしいと頼み、最後に「厩舎のまわりを嗅ぎ回る狼がいると」と、やや悪趣味な私的な冗談をそのまま伝えるよう託す。そう言って、メルウィブは海の女神リムレーンの加護があらんことをと祈りながら、君の旅立ちを見送るのだった。</p>
      <p>再び飛空艇に乗り込んだ君は、ハイウインド飛空社の案内のもと、今度はグリダニア行きの船で黒衣森へと向かう。着陸後、到着案内係はウルダハからの使者として君を歓迎し、エルダー・シードシアたるカヌ・エ・センナが到着を待っていると伝える。双蛇党の名誉護衛兵もまた、丁重な挨拶を添えつつ、まずは市街へ進んで「ノフィカの祭壇」にいる幻術士に身分を明かすよう指示する。彼女が不滅隊盟主の書簡に押された封蝋を確認すると、それが確かに最高司令官のものだと認め、君を「ロータススタンド」へと案内する。グリダニアの聖域たるその地で、カヌ・エ・センナは、森の民を代表して来訪を歓迎し、自らをグリダニアのエルダー・シードシアにして双蛇党総長と紹介する。そして、ラウバーンからの伝言を託されているのだろうと理解しつつも、その前にもう少しあなたの顔をよく見せてほしいと頼む。しばし見つめたのち、彼女は「すまない」と詫び、勇敢で気高いひとりの人物を思い出してしまったのだと打ち明けるが、すぐに話題を元に戻す。カルテノーの戦いで散った者たちを追悼する慰霊祭の提案に耳を傾けたあと、彼女は、君がガレマール帝国との戦いについてどれほど知っているかを確かめる。どうやら、他の盟主たちがすでに詳細を語っていると判断した彼女は、むしろ今後の脅威について、自らの口から説明しようと決める。あわせて、君がメルウィブから託された冗談──「厩舎のまわりを嗅ぎ回る狼」についても伝えると、カヌ・エ・センナは意味ありげな微笑みを浮かべてその意図を理解し、しかしすぐに表情を引き締めて話を続ける。</p>
      <p>彼女は、ガレマール帝国の歴史を振り返る。長きにわたり、ガレマールはイルサバード大陸に数多ある国家のひとつに過ぎず、決して大国とは言えない存在だった。しかし、今からおよそ五十年前、「魔導技術」と呼ばれる革新的な技術を手に入れたことで、忽然と頭角を現したのだと語る。その力を得た帝国は、周辺諸国を次々と征服して版図を拡大し、やがてイルサバード全土を掌中に収めると、次なる標的としてエオルゼアへとその牙を向けたのである。ただし、この急激な発展は、魔導技術だけの賜物ではなかった。初代にして現皇帝であるソルス・ゾス・ガルヴァスの卓越した指導力があってこそ、ひとりの人間の生涯で帝国を築き上げることができたのだと、彼女は評する。そのソルスも、すでに八十余年の齢を重ね、病に伏すことが多いと噂されている。後継者をめぐる宮廷内の争いが帝国の足並みを乱しているという風聞もあり、近年、帝国の動きがやや鈍っているのは、そのためかもしれないと推測する。それによって、こちらは辛うじて再建の猶予を与えられているが、決して油断はできない──なぜなら、エオルゼアには今なお、第XIV軍団が駐留しているからだ。ガイウス・ヴァン・バエサルという野心に満ちたレガトゥスが率いるその軍団が存在する限り、誰ひとり安眠を得ることはできないだろうと、カヌ・エ・センナは言葉を強める。第七霊災はこの地に甚大な被害をもたらし、各国は防衛体制を立て直すどころか、自国の傷を癒やすだけで精一杯の状態にある。そこへ追い打ちをかけるように、蛮族たちは蛮神を呼び続けており、その存在そのものが大地を蝕み、多量のエーテルを喰らっている。どの国も自国の蛮神問題に追われ、視野を国境の外へ広げる余裕すらない状況だ。そうした中で、メルウィブが送ってきた「狼」の比喩は、帝国の動きが再び活発化しつつあることを示唆しているのだと、彼女は理解する。蛮神の脅威は否定しようのないものだが、それ以上に危険なのはガレマール帝国であり、もはや各国が自国のことだけを案じていては立ち行かない。地平の向こうには嵐が迫っており、それを乗り越えるためには再び手を取り合い、ひとつにならなければならない、とカヌ・エ・センナは語る。カルテノーの戦いを振り返る慰霊祭は、かつて帝国の脅威に立ち向かったときの団結を呼び覚ますきっかけになるだろうと評し、ラウバーンの提案は実に賢明だと全面的に支持を表明する。そして、グリダニアでも同様の式典を準備し、返書はすぐに不滅隊盟主のもとへ送ると約束する。こうして、君に託された使者としての務めは果たされた。カヌ・エ・センナは、遠路はるばる森を訪れてくれたことに礼を述べ、十二神の加護が君を故郷へと無事に送り届けてくれるよう祈りながら、静かに別れを告げるのだった。</p>

      <p>在 Ul’dah 的 Steps of Nald 裡，你來到 Hall of Flames，不滅隊總司令 Raubahn Aldynn 先是要你「好好聽清楚」，表示接下來的說明會有點長。他取出幾封已經準備好的信件，那是寫給 Eorzean Alliance 其他領袖的親筆書函。Raubahn 說起五年前的 Carteneau Flats，那場戰役中，他只能眼睜睜看著同袍被先後奪走性命：先是被 Garlean Empire 擊潰，接著又被他們的陰謀呼喚出來的 primal 所吞噬。直到現在，沒有一天他不會想起那些戰死的夥伴，以及在那之後完全沒有留下任何痕跡就消失的 Warriors of Light。Calamity 帶來的悲劇並不容易被遺忘，也不應該被遺忘；正因為記得自己失去了什麼，人才會更清楚現在仍然握在手中的，是什麼樣的東西。基於這樣的想法，他決定在 Carteneau 之戰五週年的時候舉辦一場追悼儀式，向所有在戰役中犧牲的人致敬，也希望其他都市國家也能舉辦同樣的追悼儀式。為了達成這件事，他希望你能替他將這些話帶到 Limsa Lominsa 與 Gridania，成為他的親信使節。至於為何選擇你，他說，你迄今為止的種種功績，使你成為他身邊最接近「Warrior of Light」的人，他想不到比你更適合的代表。你答應之後，他正式任命你為 Ul’dah 的官方使者，同時也坦言自己沒時間、也沒耐性等你慢慢步行穿過半個大陸，於是當場給予你使用三大都市國家之間飛空艇航線的許可。這張通行證就是你擁有這項資格的證明。如今，因為隨時可能遭到帝國襲擊，飛空艇早已不是人人都能搭乘的交通工具，而是僅在特殊情況下才會發給少數人使用的東西——不過，他也提到，就算沒有這次的任務，也有人堅持僅憑你平常的表現就已經值得擁有一張。Raubahn 說，你身上的潛力對所有人來說都十分明顯，但關於這一點談到這裡就好。最後，他以 sultana 的名義要你踏上旅程，親眼看看那些 Warriors of Light 為之賭上全部的一片大地，回應 Crystal 給你的召喚，扛起屬於自己的使命。若是前路被人或是野獸阻擋，就毫不遲疑地揮下你的武器，因為勝利永遠屬於勇於挺身而出的那一方；如果有一天迷失方向，就傾聽 Crystal 的指引繼續向前。</p>
      <p>離開 Hall of Flames 回到 The Quicksand 之後，Momodi 幾乎是立刻衝向你，急著想知道 Raubahn 對你說了什麼。當她得知你被任命為 Flame General 的親信使節，要替他將話帶到其他國家的領袖那裡，而且還會「坐飛空艇」去完成這件事時，她忍不住瞪大眼睛，驚呼這簡直是份極大的榮耀。不過話說回來，她說，她也想不到有比你更適合的人選，能去做這件事。Momodi 跟你聊起，現在能搭上飛空艇的人少之又少，大部分的人一輩子從沒有機會自空中俯瞰整個 Eorzea，就離開人世，甚至沒有看過 Limsa Lominsa 海面那種特別的藍，也沒有看過 Gridania 四周層層疊疊的綠。但你不一樣，你會親眼看見這些景色，還會在每一個地方遇見各種有趣的人，聽見更多有趣的故事。她要你好好珍惜那些相遇與旅程，因為那都是用任何東西都換不來的寶藏。同時，她也提醒你，Ul’dah 以外的地方同樣問題重重，你在 Limsa 和 Gridania 也會看到當地自己的困境。老實說，她推測這也許正是 Raubahn 真正的用意——他知道你是什麼樣的人。至於是什麼樣的類型？Momodi 一邊笑一邊說，你就是那種看到別人有麻煩，就很難裝作沒看見的人，而且她希望你永遠不要改變這個性。說完祝你一路平安，她將你送到門口。來到 Ul’dah 的 Airship Landing，Highwind Skyways 的 Elyenora 認出你是 Flame General 的使節，恭敬地為你安排前往 Limsa Lominsa 的班次。等到登機時間一到，廣播催促乘客前往登機門，你在船艙裡聽見飛空艇乘務員的提醒，同時在地面上，Nanamo、Momodi 等人，也在心中為你送上「願你永遠行走於 Crystal 之光之中」的祝福，看著飛空艇逐漸遠離 Ul’dah 的天空。</p>
      <p>在飛行途中，Echo 再次發動，你的視野忽然從寧靜的艙內抽離，來到 Eastern La Noscea 的 Castrum Occidens。Gaius van Baelsar 站在鋼鐵築成的要塞高處，俯瞰著遺跡與海岸，提起一段更久之前的歷史。他說，十五年已經過去，但失敗的苦澀至今仍未散去——當年，帝國艦隊在 Agrius 旗艦的率領下駛向 Mor Dhona，認為只要拿下 Silvertear Lake，整個 Eorzea 很快就會落入他們的掌心。然而那一天迎接他們的，是數不清的 dragons，而在那群龍的中心，是 Midgardsormr 本人。帝國軍雖然成功擊殺了這位龍中之王，卻也為此付出失去「無敵旗艦」Agrius 的代價，連帶葬送了那次征服的所有希望。Gaius 認為，Eorzea 是被 false gods 腐蝕的荒蕪之地，已經兩度從帝國的掌中溜走；即便 Meteor 這個大罪將整片大陸化為火海，也未能為 Garlemald 帶來真正的控制權，反而使這個世界更加墮落混亂。然而在他眼中，這樣的世界「必須被拯救」，而能帶來秩序的只有 Garlean rule，只有帝國才能把這片土地上的人們從無知中解放出來。就在這段話的背景中，基地裡的擴音器呼叫工程師前往魔導科技研究區，兩名工程師小聲談論 legatus 是否真的打算再對 Eorzea 展開行動，一個驚訝於新的大規模軍事行動正在準備當中。兩人的對話很快被 Nero tol Scaeva 打斷，他禮貌地追問出身地，接著認出其中一人其實是代號「Hummingway」的間諜。儘管對方結結巴巴想否認，他卻冷冷地說，不管怎麼辯解都不會改變結果，因為 Frumentarium 早已掌握一切，隨後便讓那名工程師就地斃命。顫抖著的另一人被命令「把這一切收拾乾淨，不准漏掉任何東西」，而 Nero 在轉身離去前，低聲對不存在於現場的 Garlond 發出宣言——不久之後，對方就會親身體會什麼才是真正的魔導科技之力。</p>
      <p>當 Echo 的影像散去，你已經來到 Limsa Lominsa 的 Airship Landing，腳下踏上 Vylbrand 的土地。到達接待員一見到你就確信你是從 Ul’dah 來的使節，恭敬地歡迎你，並告知 Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn 已經在等候你的到來。隨後，穿著 Storm 之制服的榮譽近衛在入口處等著你，確認你是 Ul’dah 使節之後，請你先前往 Crow’s Lift，下去 Bulwark Hall。到了那裡，Zanthael 迎上前，先是有禮貌地請你讓他檢查 Flame General 書函上的封印。確認封印確實是 Immortal Flames 最高指揮官的印記後，他向你表示歉意，說在現在這種情勢之下，他們不能有任何鬆懈，接著便帶你前往 Bridge 上的 command room。進門時，Merlwyb 簡短地說了一聲「進來」，視線落在你身上。她提到，Ul’dah 那些銀舌如簧的商人居然派一位冒險者來替他們說話，看來相當信任你。隨後，她正式自我介紹，說自己是 Limsa Lominsa 的 Admiral，也是 Maelstrom 的總帥，然後詢問 Thanalan 那邊有什麼消息。不過在你開口之前，她先要求知道你的名字。聽完你的自我介紹，她微微皺眉，說總覺得好像在哪裡見過你，但仔細想想卻又找不到對應的記憶；她笑說，或許有時候會想不起舊友的臉，但敵人的臉絕對不會忘記，會忘記敵人的 Admiral 可就糟糕了。丟下這句半玩笑半認真的話之後，她要你繼續說下去。你將 Raubahn 提出的追悼儀式傳達給她，她低聲重複了一遍「為了紀念 Carteneau 倒下的人們而舉行儀式」，這才驚覺原來自那場戰役以來已經過了整整五年。她回憶起當年 Garlean Empire 試圖從他們手中奪走 Eorzea，各國於是重新編組 Grand Company，讓 Eorzean Alliance 再次誕生。然而 Garlemald 並不打算只靠單純的軍事對抗來決勝負，而是啟動了 Meteor project——由 Legatus Nael van Darnus 主導，打算把 lesser moon Dalamud 從天上「砸」下來，把整個大陸視為需要被「清洗」的目標。為了阻止這個狂妄的計畫，他們不惜集結軍力前往 Carteneau Flats 與第 VII 軍團展開決戰。</p>
      <p>Merlwyb 說，她這一生見過數不清的戰場，但像 Carteneau 之戰那樣的規模與慘烈，卻只有那一次。即使他們毫不保留地全力戰鬥、毫不退讓，卻依舊無法阻止接下來發生的事——從 Dalamud 的殼中破出來的，是一頭巨大的有翼惡夢，那是一條大到可以吞下一整座 city 的 dragon，也就是 elder primal Bahamut，企圖將 Eorzea 化作第八個地獄。帝國軍團在瞬間就被火焰吞沒，他們自己的聯軍也好不到哪裡去；當時的景象，就像整個世界都燒了起來一樣，單靠語言根本無法完全描述。然而，即使在那種極端的絕境中，仍有少數人被奇蹟般地保留下來。Merlwyb 回憶說，就在她做好赴死準備的瞬間，一道刺眼的白光包裹住她，奪走了她所有的感官；等她醒來時，Bahamut 已經消失無蹤，只剩下仍然在冒煙的土地，以完全陌生又扭曲的姿態躺在她腳下。如果 Archon Louisoix 還在世，他或許能對這些難以理解的事給出解釋，但很可惜，現在已經沒有辦法再請教他。眼下，各國還在為修復 Calamity 留下的巨大創傷忙得不可開交，beast tribes 卻一再召喚自己的 primals，把大地的 aether 一點一滴抽乾。每個國家都被自身的 primal 問題拖住手腳，根本沒有餘力去關心其他地方的狀況。更糟的是，Garlemald 從未放棄對 Eorzea 的野心，帝國軍仍然在邊境徘徊，只是在等待重新出擊的時機。她說，他們確實需要新的 champions 來替補那些失去的英雄，但光是這樣想也沒有用，時間不會因為他們悲歎就停下腳步。沒有任何外來的救世主會突然出現拯救所有人；能夠救自己的人，只有在 Calamity 中存活下來的自己。她認為，這場追悼儀式正好能幫助人們回想起當年在帝國威脅之下團結一致的精神，因此斷言 Raubahn 的提案非常正確。她當場答應會在 Limsa Lominsa 也舉辦同樣的追悼儀式，並保證會親自將回信送到 Flame General 手中。至此，你在 Limsa 的使命算是完成。她接著問你接下來會前往 Gridania，請你順便代為向 Elder Seedseer 問好，並讓你轉告一句私下的玩笑話：「就說最近有一隻狼一直在她的馬廄附近到處嗅來嗅去。」她自己也承認這玩笑有點品味不佳，但仍然希望你原句轉達。最後，Merlwyb 祝福你旅途平安，願 Navigator 的指引一路陪伴你。</p>
      <p>接著，你再次搭上 Highwind Skyways 的飛空艇，前往被 Black Shroud 包圍的 Gridania。到達之後，Gridania 的到達接待員立刻認出你是從 Ul’dah 派來的使節，表示 Elder Seedseer 正在等你。Serpent Honor Guard 也前來迎接，對你致意之後，要你先進入 city proper，在 Nophica’s Altar 找一位 conjurer 並表明身分，那位 Silent Conjurer 則會把你帶進 Lotus Stand。抵達祭壇後，Silent Conjurer 恭敬地向你致歉，說明必須先確認你帶來的書函是否真的出自 Immortal Flames 最高指揮官之手。她仔細檢查封印，確認無誤後，便邀請你跟著她一起前往 Gridania 的聖域 Lotus Stand。那是一片綠意與靜謐守護著的場所，Kan-E-Senna 在那裡迎接你，代表整個國家向你致以歡迎之意。她自我介紹說，自己是 Gridania 的 Elder Seedseer，也是 Order of the Twin Adder 的領袖，知道你帶著 Flame General 的訊息而來。不過，在你開口之前，她先請求能更仔細地看看你的臉。她凝視你片刻，隨即道歉，說你讓她想起了過去認識的一位勇敢而高貴的靈魂，這才一時失神。很快地，她收起感傷，回到你此行的目的，聽完 Raubahn 想在 Carteneau 戰死者身上舉辦追悼儀式的提案後，溫和地問你對過去與 Empire 的衝突了解多少。她聽得出你已經從別人口中聽過不少細節，於是改以未來的局勢為重點，打算親自說明 Garlemald 的威脅。你也照著 Merlwyb 的交代，把那句「最近有一隻狼一直在她的馬廄附近嗅來嗅去」轉告給她。Kan-E-Senna 聽完輕輕一笑，顯然明白這句話的弦外之音，但很快就又回到正題。</p>
      <p>她向你解說，Garlemald 在歷史的大部分時間裡，其實並不被視為 Ilsabard 上特別強盛的國家；真正讓它開始崛起的，是大約五十年前出現的魔導科技。靠著這種前所未有的力量，帝國迅速征服周邊國家，把一個又一個鄰居納入自己的版圖，最後幾乎整個 Ilsabard 都落入其掌控之中，然後才把目光投向 Eorzea。然而，Garlemald 的興起並不只是因為魔導科技，本身也與其初代兼現任的皇帝有關——Solus zos Galvus 是一個在自己的一生中就親手打造帝國版圖的人。如今，這位皇帝已經歷經超過四十個冬季，被傳言身體日漸衰弱、時常抱病在床；外界更流傳著關於繼承問題使 imperial court 內部動盪的說法，而這也許就能解釋為何這幾年帝國在 Eorzea 表面上的動作比較少，讓各都市國家得到一點喘息的時間。但就算如此，他們也絕對不能因此鬆懈，因為 XIVth Imperial Legion 仍然駐紮在 Eorzea，由野心昭然若揭的 Gaius van Baelsar 領軍。只要他還吸著這片土地的空氣，就沒有人能真正安然入睡。Kan-E-Senna 說，Calamity 帶來的破壞之大，讓各個國家這些年來幾乎只能忙著療傷，根本沒有足夠的力量重建完整的防禦體系，更別說正面擊退 Empire。同時間，beast tribes 一次又一次召喚他們的 primals，那些存在本身就在消耗大地的 aether，讓土地愈來愈疲憊。於是，每一個國家都被自己的 primal 問題綁住，沒有人有餘裕去關心國境之外發生的事。正因如此，她將 Merlwyb 所說的「狼」理解為關於 Empire 動向的暗示——Admiral 想告訴她，Garlemald 可能很快就會再次行動。她承認 primals 確實構成了極大的威脅，但更大的威脅仍是帝國，如果各國繼續只顧著自己國內的情況，不願意為整個大陸著想，那麼面對未來的風暴只會被各個擊破。地平線上正在醞釀一場風暴，要撐過這場風暴，就必須像從前一樣重新站在一起。Kan-E-Senna 認為，這場追悼儀式很有可能重新喚起 Eorzea 人民曾經共同對抗帝國時的那份團結，因此說 Flame General 的提案相當睿智。她明確表態會在 Gridania 也準備相同的儀式，並表示會立刻把回信送回 Raubahn 的手上。至此，你作為 Ul’dah 使節的任務已經全部完成。Kan-E-Senna 向你道謝，感謝你遠道而來，最後祝福你回程一路平安，願 Twelve 的守護陪著你走完接下來的路。</p>
