    story:`<div class="clamp" data-collapsed="true">
<p>Nashu greets you in Kugane with her usual boundless energy, exclaiming how bright-eyed and ready for adventure you look before announcing that she has “news.” Since your last investigation, she has been asking around about the notorious Wolf Burglar—the same thief who left that cheeky note claiming credit for Akebono’s robbery—and she has come to the conclusion that he is not quite as stealthy as he thinks he is. Yes, he has relieved a great many rich merchants of their treasures, and his calling card leaves no doubt as to which crimes are his. But precisely because he insists on signing his work, witnesses have seen him again and again. After listening to their accounts, Nashu even tried her hand at sketching a portrait of the culprit, proudly presenting her self-taught “artistry” to you. Your reaction, however—whether honest critique or stunned silence—fails to offer the encouragement she hoped for. With a little sigh, she concedes that perhaps the drawing isn’t her masterpiece after all and decides to return to “the metaphorical drawing board.” Instead of relying on her picture, she proposes the more practical plan of questioning the wealthy and influential citizens the burglar favors as targets. She will canvass Kogane Dori, she says, while you speak to patrons of the nearby teahouse and hostelry.</p>
<p>At Pier 2 you meet a Preening Pundit who is in no mood to hear the Wolf Burglar’s name. He complains that your question has ruined his peaceful moment of sea air and admits, with theatrical outrage, that he too has been victimized. The vase the thief stole was, in his memory, a magnificent treasure, and the loss still stings. Grumbling about justice, he declares that if the world were fair, the Wolf Burglar would be paraded through the streets and boiled alive in Tenkonto for all to see. Some people argue that cruel and unusual punishments do nothing to deter criminals, he notes, but he clearly believes that a good public boiling has its merits. At the Umineko Teahouse, Byakudan is more composed. He knows of the thief by reputation but says he and his companions are of modest means and have been spared. If you mistook him for a wealthy man, he explains, it is only because this teahouse visit is his single indulgence; the rest of his life is frugal. He doubts the Wolf Burglar will bother with people like him, no matter how genteel their surroundings may appear.</p>
<p>At the Shiokaze Hostelry, Uraki greets you warmly, saying it has been far too long since he last shared a pipe with an ijin. When you decline the offer to smoke and ask instead about the Wolf Burglar, he shrugs and warns that he has no special insight to share. What he knows is what everyone knows: the thief is a “lone wolf,” working without comrades, and the Sekiseigumi, despite serious efforts, have no solid leads. Rumor has it that repeated success has only emboldened the man. Each new theft is more brazen than the last, and there are now tales of him practicing his trade in broad daylight. That, Uraki says, is the extent of his knowledge. If you will not sit and trade stories or indulge in a pipe, he prefers to be left alone with his smoke—a companion that, in his view, demands far less from him than conversation.</p>
<p>When you regroup with Nashu in Kogane Dori, she eagerly asks if you have uncovered anything useful. Hearing that the thief’s crimes are growing more audacious, she nods gravely and remarks that, if there is anything she has learned from following the inspector, it is that overconfidence has a way of getting you smacked upside the head by your mother’s magic frying pan. She would dearly like to catch this “wolf” in the act, but to do so, they need to know who he plans to rob next. As she puzzles over this, a young boy suddenly cries out when someone nearly tramples him underfoot. Shigure, the very samurai you met before, hastens to apologize, insisting he meant no harm and was simply lost in thought about his investigation. Nashu recognizes him immediately—“Shiggy-something,” as she calls him—and remembers that he was also hunting the Wolf Burglar. When she presses him for news, he reveals a promising lead: a private auction is to be held in which many foreign wares will be put up for sale. Such auctions are not unusual in Kugane, but the timing is suspicious; it has been some time since the Wolf Burglar last struck, and rumor has it that this particular auction will feature “extraordinary” items that might tempt a bold thief.</p>
<p>Shigure apologizes for his haste and says he must hurry to the auction venue, but Nashu calls after him, asking if they may accompany him. He warns that the goods on offer will be prohibitively expensive and doubts they will be able to afford anything. Without missing a beat, Nashu boasts that you are wealthy enough to buy and sell him a thousand times over. Surprised but unwilling to argue, Shigure accepts this at face value and invites you both along. Soon after, he leads you to a reserved space on Kogane Dori, explaining that this is the site of the private auction and that the distinguished guests should be arriving at any moment. Among the gathering crowd, Nashu recognizes Master Akebono. He expresses mild surprise at seeing the “inspectors” again but assumes you are there to keep watch for the Wolf Burglar. If you happen to see something you like, he suggests, money changers are on hand to convert foreign currency. Then, with a competitive glint in his eye, he warns that if you and he desire the same item, he has no intention of yielding without a fight.</p>
<p>The auction begins under the guidance of a Silver-tongued Broker, who welcomes the “prosperous and esteemed elite” and promises them a selection of rare and curious items from across the world. The first lot is a “queer, misshapen fiend” captured in the wild mountains of Yanxia—a so-called “ratman,” an unholy hybrid of man and beast whose flesh supposedly grants eternal life to those who eat it. The broker calls for an opening bid of five hundred thousand koban, and several patrons eagerly raise the stakes. Akebono ultimately claims the creature with a bid of eight hundred thousand koban, to the astonishment of the crowd. Nashu, watching from the side, whispers in horror, wondering aloud if he truly intends to eat the unfortunate Qiqirn. The next item, the broker announces, is a “statue” brought from the western lands of Eorzea. In truth, he says, the word “statue” hardly does it justice; this “Eoruzean Gentleman” is a masterpiece, a triumph of sculptural art whose exquisitely rendered features have led some to call it indistinguishable from a living man frozen in time. As the cloth covering is pulled away, Nashu gasps. The sculpture is the spitting image of Inspector Hildibrand, down to his familiar pose. She wonders if a devoted admirer might have sculpted it.</p>
<p>Shigure, however, peers more closely and remarks that he thought he saw the statue twitch. At once, Nashu jumps to a more dramatic conclusion: perhaps the inspector has been frozen by temporal magicks and turned into living stone. If so, she declares, she has just the thing to restore him—a trusty bomb. Shigure quickly stops her, horrified at the thought of her detonating explosives in a crowded market and wiping out half the guests. Nashu pauses and reluctantly admits that blowing up innocent bystanders would not be very “inspector-like” behavior. Meanwhile, the Silver-tongued Broker and the bidders begin to notice subtle changes in the statue’s expression. Akebono and the Rotund Oligarch murmur that they do not recall such a look of abject terror on its face earlier. Cornered, the broker hastily improvises, claiming this is no ordinary statue but a marvelous fusion of sculpture and automaton, capable of shifting its features with lifelike fluidity. Having thus “explained” the anomaly, he sets the starting bid at five hundred thousand koban. A spirited contest follows, and once again Akebono leads the pack, shouting a high offer to secure the Eorzean Gentleman as his own.</p>
<p>Nashu, aghast, realizes that if nothing is done, these people will literally purchase Inspector Hildibrand as if he were an art piece. Whether you attempt to outbid Akebono or not, the merchant triumphantly raises the stakes to a staggering one million koban, declaring that there is nothing in this world he cannot buy. Before the sale can be finalized, a sudden disturbance draws everyone’s attention. Coughing and confusion fill the room, and when the dust settles, the Eorzean Gentleman has vanished from the stage. In its place lies a now-familiar cheeky note: “You have just been robbed by the Kugane Wolf Burglar!” Shigure curses the thief as a thrice-damned oni, furious that he has struck yet again at the very event they were using as bait. Akebono, still sputtering, insists he saw the culprit—a wolfish-looking fiend—seize the statue and flee toward the Short Pier. Nashu, putting the pieces together in her own way, cries that Inspector Hildibrand has been stolen, or rather kidnapped, by the Wolf Burglar. She imagines dire possibilities, including the thief trying to eat him like the “ratman,” and insists they must give chase at once.</p>
<p>At the Short Pier, Nashu continues to marvel at the absurdity of the situation. Even for Inspector Hildibrand, being “stolen” as a statue is a first. A nearby captain, curt but cooperative, recounts what he saw: a Lupin carrying a grotesquely twisted mockery of a man on his back, boarding a small boat and departing for the Ruby Price. Shigure, who had arrived ahead of you, confirms that this report matches his own understanding of the thief’s escape route. He muses that the Wolf Burglar’s boldness has finally given them a trail to follow; by seizing such an eye-catching prize in broad daylight and fleeing by boat, the thief has traded anonymity for a series of witnesses. Shigure proposes that they hurry to the Ruby Price to continue the pursuit. Nashu, staring up at the distant tower on the horizon, mutters that it just keeps going “up and up and up,” then quickly shakes off her awe. With the inspector’s “stone” body in the hands of a hungry thief, there is no time to waste.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the Ruby Price, you find Nashu still staring at the towering structure, repeating that it stretches endlessly into the sky. Shigure turns his attention to the matter at hand, reasoning that someone stationed here must have seen a Lupin passing through with a stolen statue. He questions Hayama, one of the watchmen, but the man apologetically admits that he has no recollection of such a sight. Since the withdrawal of Garlean forces from Doma and the Ruby Sea, domestic sea traffic has increased significantly. In response, the authorities have been instructed to wave smaller vessels through without thorough inspection unless there is a clear cause for suspicion. The Lupin you seek, Hayama explains, was likely no more than one of many travelers granted a cursory glance before being allowed to sail on. Shigure thanks him for his time and excuses himself, taking care to be polite despite the dead end. Stepping back, he reflects that their quarry has slipped through their grasp for now and wonders aloud who else might keep close watch over these waters. The search must continue, and if they are to find the Wolf Burglar—and rescue Inspector Hildibrand—they will need to look beyond the usual checkpoints for the next clue.</p>

<p>クガネの街角で、ナシュ・マカラッカはいつものように元気いっぱいにあなたを迎えた。「フォルネームだ！ 今日も目がきらきら、尻尾ふさふさだね！」とでも言いたげな勢いで挨拶を済ませると、「とっておきのニュースがあるんだよ！」と身を乗り出す。彼女は例のウルフバーグラー──先日、挑発的なメッセージを残していたあの怪盗──について、あちこちで聞き込みを続けてきたのだという。話をまとめるに、あの男は自分で思っているほど「こっそり」していないらしい。たしかに、大勢の裕福な商人から財宝を奪い去り、そのたびに必ず犯行声明代わりのカードを残すことで、腕前を見せつけてきた。しかし、その派手さゆえに、目撃談も次々と集まっていた。ナシュは集めた証言をもとに、自分なりに犯人の似顔絵を描いてみたのだと胸を張る。自称「独学アーティスト」の力作を誇らしげに掲げるが、あなたの反応はどうにも歯切れが悪い。素直な評価であれ言葉を失った沈黙であれ、期待したほどの支持は得られず、ナシュは小さく肩を落として「やっぱり描き直しかな……比喩的な意味でのね」と苦笑する。そこで彼女は、絵に頼るのをやめ、もっと堅実な方法を取ることにした。すなわち、怪盗が狙いそうな富裕層──すでに被害を受けた者たち──に直接話を聞きに行くというのだ。彼女は黄金通りを調べると言い、あなたには茶屋と宿屋の聞き込みを託す。</p>
<p>波止場に向かったあなたは、まず「プレーニングなご意見番」といった風情の男に出会う。海風を楽しんでいた彼は、ウルフバーグラーの名を耳にした途端、「せっかくのくつろぎの時間が台無しだ」と憤慨する。やがて彼は、そんな自分もまたあの狼めいた盗人の被害者なのだと認め、奪われる前の壺がどれほど見事な品であったかを嘆き始める。悔しさをこめて、「世の中に本当の正義があるのなら、あの悪党は街中を引き回された挙げ句、天主堂で熱湯の釜ゆでにされるべきだ」と極端な罰を口にする者もいるのだと語り、「残酷な見せしめは犯罪抑止にならない」という意見を一蹴する。「公開ゆで刑の良さを分かっていない」と言わんばかりだ。続いて埠頭近くの「海猫茶屋」に入ると、ビャクダンという男が、あの悪名高い盗人の噂なら知っていると頷く。幸いなことに、自分や仲間のようなささやかな暮らしをする者たちは、まだ標的にされてはいないという。あなたが茶屋でくつろぐ彼を見て裕福だと勘違いしたのかもしれないが、彼にとってこれは唯一の贅沢であり、それ以外の生活は慎ましいのだと明かす。見かけに反して財産はごくわずかであり、ウルフバーグラーから狙われる心配はあまりしていない、と彼は静かに微笑む。</p>
<p>塩風宿に足を運ぶと、ウラキという男が、久々に異国の客と煙管を交わせると喜ばしげに迎えてくれる。だが、あなたが煙草ではなくウルフバーグラーについての情報を求めると、彼は肩をすくめ、特別な体験談は持ち合わせていないと前置きする。彼の知るところでは、あの盗人は仲間を持たぬ「一匹狼」であり、赤誠組がいかに捜査に力を入れても、いまだ決定的な手がかりは掴めていないという話だ。さらに、度重なる成功が彼を助長させたのか、最近では盗みの手口がますます大胆になり、真昼間から堂々と盗みを働く姿を目撃した者まで現れているのだと語る。残念ながら、彼が提供できる情報はそこで尽きる。もしあなたが武勇伝か旅の話を聞かせてくれるなら、もう少し長く付き合う気もあるが、煙を吸わない客が長居するのであれば、気ままな煙管の相手のほうが気楽だと、彼は穏やかに笑ってあなたを見送る。</p>
<p>黄金通りでナシュと合流すると、彼女は目を輝かせて「何か面白い話は聞けた？」と身を乗り出す。盗人が最近ますます大胆になっているという話を聞くと、ナシュは真剣な顔でうなずき、「インスペクターについていくなかで学んだことがひとつある」と言って、過信はたいてい、お母さんの魔法のフライパンで頭を殴られる原因になるのだと笑い混じりに語る。とはいえ、狼を現行犯で捕まえるには、次にどこを狙うのかを知る必要がある。ふたりが思案に暮れていると、近くから少年の悲鳴が上がり、誰かが足を滑らせて踏みつけてしまったようだ。慌てて謝るのは、先日楽座街でぶつかった侍──シギュルだった。彼は「若君、申し訳ない」と頭を下げ、決して踏みつけるつもりはなく、捜査のことで頭がいっぱいだったのだと弁解する。ナシュはすぐに彼に気づき、「この前ぶつかったサムライさん、シギー何とかだっけ？」と首を傾げる。シギュルは彼女を見て目を丸くし、再会を喜びながらも、自分が歩行者を踏みつけて回るような男だと思われていないかと慌てて否定する。もっぱらウルフバーグラーの捜査に心を奪われていたのだと説明すると、ナシュはさっそく「そっちもまだ追ってるんだよね？ 何か手がかりは？」と質問をぶつける。</p>
<p>シギュルは少し躊躇しつつも、最近知った情報を打ち明ける。近く、外国産の品々を集めた私的な競売が開かれる予定であり、その目録には「とりわけ珍しく、特別な品」が含まれているという噂があるのだ。クガネではこの手の競売自体は珍しくないが、ここしばらくウルフバーグラーの動きが途絶えていること、そして高価な輸入品が一堂に会することを考えれば、格好の標的になる可能性が高い。そう話すとシギュルは、名残惜しそうにしながらも、すぐに会場に向かわねばならないと告げる。しかしナシュが「シギーさん、私たちも一緒に行っていい？」と身を乗り出すと、彼は目を瞬かせて、「競売に、ですか？ ですが、あそこで扱われる品々は、とてつもなく高価なものばかりで……」と心配そうに言葉を濁す。ナシュはそこで胸を張り、「フォルネームならね、あなたを千回買って売っても大丈夫なくらいお金持ちなんだよ！」とさらりと言い放つ。シギュルは戸惑いながらも、その言葉を否定する術もなく、「そ、そうですか……では、どうぞご一緒に」と頷き、一行を会場へと案内する。程なくして、彼は黄金通りの一角にある、貸し切りの一室へとあなたたちを通し、ここが今夜の私的競売会場であり、まもなく招待客たちが集まってくるだろうと説明する。客のなかには、見覚えのある商人アケボノの姿もあった。彼はあなたとナシュを見ると驚き、「またお会いするとは」と挨拶し、まさかここでまでウルフバーグラーを見張りに来たのではないだろうなと冗談めかして言う。もし気に入った品があれば外貨両替を扱う者もいるから、遠慮なく入札するといいと勧めたうえで、「ただし、もし私と同じ品を狙うのなら、簡単には譲らない」と、負けん気の強さも隠さない。</p>
<p>やがて「口のうまい仲買人」が登場し、「本日は、豊かにして高貴なる皆さまを、この会場にお迎えできたことを光栄に存じます」と、あおるような口上で競売の開幕を告げる。今宵は世界各地から集められた珍品奇品が披露され、望むならば購入することもできるのだと約束し、まず最初の品を紹介する。それはヤンサの山中で捕らえられたという奇怪な魔物で、「ねずみ人間」と呼ばれる伝説上の存在──半分は人、半分は獣、その肉を食らえば永遠の命を得られる、と吹聴される代物だった。仲買人は自信満々に「まずは五十万コバンから始めましょう！」と宣言し、場内から次々と入札の声が上がる。最終的にアケボノが八十万コバンという巨額を叫び、会場はどよめきに包まれる。ナシュはそのやり取りを見ながら、小声で「あの子、本当に食べられちゃうのかな……？」と、捕らえられたキキルンの運命を案じて顔をしかめる。続いて仲買人は、次の品として、西方エオルゼアから運び込まれた「像」を紹介する。ただし、「像」という言葉ではとうてい説明しきれないほど精緻で、息を呑むような作品であり、その名も「エオルゼア・ジェントルマン」。その姿は、あたかも生きた紳士が時間を止められたかのようだと持ち上げられる。おおげさな前振りのあと、覆い布が取り払われると、ナシュは目を丸くして叫ぶ。そこに立っていたのは、紛れもなくヒルディブランドに瓜二つの彫像だったのだ。彼女は「もしかして熱心なファンが彫ったのかな？」と首をかしげる。</p>
<p>しかしシギュルは眉をひそめ、今しがた「像」がわずかに動いたように見えたことを口にする。するとナシュは、すぐさま一歩先を行く（方向違いの）結論に飛びつく。これはきっと時間停止の魔法か何かで固められたインスペクター本人に違いなく、だったら彼を元に戻すための「特効薬」はもう決まっている──そう、爆弾だ、と言い出すのだ。彼女が爆薬入りの小包を取り出しかけたところで、シギュルは顔面蒼白になって止めに入り、「ここで爆発させれば、罪なき客たちまで吹き飛ばしてしまう」と必死に説得する。ナシュは少し考え、「たしかに、人を助けるために一緒に吹き飛ばすのはインスペクター的じゃないかも」と渋々納得する。その一方で、仲買人と入札者たちは、像の表情に微妙な変化があることに気づき始める。アケボノやふくよかな富豪は、「さっきよりずっと怯えた顔をしていないか」「もっと穏やかな表情だったはずだ」と囁き合う。追い詰められた仲買人は、とっさに「皆さま、なんと鋭いご指摘……そう、この像はただの彫刻ではございません」と話をすり替え、実は彫刻とからくり人形が融合した、かつてない芸術作品であり、表情が自在に変化するのもその証だと苦し紛れの説明をする。そして気を取り直すように、「さあ、この唯一無二の像の入札を、五十万コバンから始めましょう！」と呼びかける。場内の競争は再び激しさを増し、ここでもアケボノが先陣を切って高額の入札を繰り返す。</p>
<p>ナシュは、その様子を見て青ざめる。このままでは、本物のインスペクターがただの美術品として落札されてしまうのだ。あなたが割って入って入札しようとするかどうかに関わらず、アケボノは勝ち誇ったように声を張り上げ、「この世に、金で買えぬものなどない！ 一百万コバンだ！」と最終札を叩きつける。会場がざわめき、落札が確定しようとしたその瞬間、突然周囲が騒がしくなり、咳き込む声や混乱のざわめきが広がる。視線が戻ったときには、舞台上から「エオルゼア・ジェントルマン」の姿が消えていた。その代わりに残されていたのは、見覚えのある挑発的なメモ──「『クガネ・ウルフバーグラー』が、ありがたく頂戴した」と書かれたカードだった。シギュルは「何度目だ、この羅刹め！」と舌打ちし、自分たちの目の前で再び盗みを働いた狼賊を激しく罵る。アケボノは咳き込みながら、「見たぞ……狼のような顔をした賊が、あの像を背負って短い桟橋のほうへ逃げていった」と証言する。ナシュは頭の中で事態を整理し、「つまりインスペクター・ヒルディブランドが盗まれた──誘拐されたってことだよね！？」と叫び出す。彼女は、あのキキルンのように食べられてしまうのではと想像して、慌ててウルフバーグラーの後を追おうと駆け出すのだった。</p>
<p>短い桟橋に辿り着いたナシュは、それでもなお「インスペクターが盗まれちゃうなんて、さすがに初めてだよね……」と半ば信じられない様子で首を振る。近くにいた船長は、そっけない口調ながらも、先ほど見た光景を繰り返し説明する。狼のような男が、ひどくねじ曲がった人型の像を背負って小舟に乗り込み、ルビープライスのほうへ漕ぎ出していった──そんな奇妙な光景はそうそう忘れられるものではない、と。先に到着していたシギュルは、それがまさに自分たちの追う賊であると確認し、「本日ばかりは、あまりにも大胆すぎた」と唇を噛む。真昼の競売でこれほど目立つ獲物に手を出したことで、賊は多くの目撃者と足跡を残したのだ。だが、それは同時に追跡の手がかりにもなる。「さあ、紅玉海のルビープライスへ急ぎましょう」と彼は促し、ナシュは遠くにそびえ立つ塔を見上げながら、「あの塔、どこまで伸びてるんだろうね……」とつぶやきつつも、インスペクターの身を案じて足を速める。</p>
<p>ルビープライスに到着しても、ナシュはなおも塔を見上げ、「本当に、ずーっと上まで続いてるんだね」と感嘆の息を漏らす。だがシギュルはすぐに気持ちを切り替え、ここで誰かが、像を担いだルパンの姿を見ていないかを確かめようとする。彼は見張り役のハヤマに声をかけるが、男は申し訳なさそうに首を振る。ドマと紅玉海からガレマール軍が撤退して以来、内国の船舶往来は著しく増加し、小型の船舶については、特段の不審点がない限り検査を簡略化するよう通達が出ているのだという。あなたたちが追うルパンも、おそらく数多くの船のひとつとして、ろくに顔も見られぬまま通されてしまったのだろうと説明する。シギュルは丁寧に礼を述べ、邪魔をしたことを詫びてからその場を離れる。彼はひとつ息をつき、「どうやら、今回はここで尻尾をつかむことはできなかったようですね」と呟きながら、この海域を注意深く監視している別の相手がいないか、あらためて考え始める。ウルフバーグラーの行方も、石と化したインスペクターの運命も、まだ霧の中だ。だが、必ず次の手がかりを見つけ出してみせると、彼の瞳は捜査の炎を絶やすことなく燃やし続けているのだった。</p>

<p>在 Kugane 的街頭，Nashu Mhakaracca 一如往常地活力滿點地迎上前來，一看到你就笑著說你今天看起來精神飽滿、隨時可以出發解案。她神秘地眨眨眼，說自己有「大消息」要告訴你。原來在上次事件之後，她一直在各處打聽那位 Wolf Burglar 的情報──就是之前留下挑釁字條、公開宣告自己犯案的那個怪盜。經過一番蒐集，她得出的結論是：那傢伙其實沒有自以為的那麼「隱蔽」。的確，他已經讓許多富商栽了跟頭，每次犯案也都會留下 calling card，讓人不可能弄錯犯人是誰。但也正是因為這份自負，目擊證言反而越來越多。Nashu 說，她仔細聽完大家的描述後，試著自己畫出犯人的「肖像畫」，得意洋洋地把作品拿給你看，自稱是「自學成才的 artiste」。然而，你的反應──不管是委婉的評論還是沉默的表情──都沒有達到她期望中的稱讚。她只好苦笑著承認這幅畫也許不算成功，說自己還是回「畫板」上重來比較好，不過這次是比喻上的畫板。於是她決定改用更實際的方法：直接去問那些成為目標的有錢人，從被害者身上挖出新的線索。她要去 Kogane Dori 接觸商人與達官顯要，而你則被拜託去茶館與旅館打聽消息。</p>
<p>你先在碼頭遇到一名 Preening Pundit，他一邊享受海風，一邊擺出一副自命不凡的姿態。一聽見你提起「Kugane Wolf Burglar」這個名字，他的臉色立刻變得難看，抱怨你破壞了他本來愉快的休息時光。隨著話題推進，他才承認自己也是那名賊的受害者之一，並以誇張的語氣形容被偷走之前，那只花瓶是多麼完美，現在想起來仍然覺得心痛。他激動地說，如果這個世界真的存在正義，那名賊早就該被押上街頭示眾，最後在 Tenkonto 被活活煮成一鍋。有人說「殘酷又不尋常的刑罰根本無法嚇阻犯罪」，但在他看來，那只是那些人不懂「公開煮刑」的價值。隨後你走進 Umineko Teahouse，Byakudan 則用較為平和的態度回應。他也聽說過那位惡名昭彰的盜賊，但慶幸的是，像他這樣家境普通的茶客，目前還沒有被盯上。若你因為他常來茶館就以為他很有錢，那可是一場誤會──這裡是他唯一放縱自己的地方，生活其他部分都很節省。就算表面看起來體面，實際上他的財力相當有限，他並不認為自己會成為 Wolf Burglar 的目標。</p>
<p>在 Shiokaze Hostelry 裡，Uraki 熱情地招呼你，說已經很久沒有跟 ijin 坐下來一起抽煙、聊天了。可惜你今天沒有興致分享煙斗，只是開門見山地問起 Wolf Burglar 的事。他聳聳肩說，自己沒有親身遭遇，也沒有什麼祕密情報能補充，所知道的都是大家口耳相傳的內容。根據他聽來的說法，那名賊是一匹「孤狼」，沒有任何同伴，Sekiseigumi 即使花了大力氣追查，到現在還是沒有什麼實質進展。或許正因如此，這個人反而愈來愈大膽，每一次下手都比上一次嚇人，甚至已經有人聲稱在白天光天化日下看到他行竊。說到這裡，Uraki 攤開雙手表示，他能提供的資訊就到此為止。如果你願意留下來聊聊自己的冒險故事，也許他還會留你一起抽一支煙；既然你沒有這個打算，他還是覺得讓煙霧陪他就好，那樣安靜又省事。</p>
<p>當你回到 Kogane Dori 與 Nashu 會合時，她立刻湊上前來，問你有沒有聽到什麼「刺激的消息」。聽說 Wolf Burglar 的行徑愈來愈放肆，她先是點頭表示同意，接著半開玩笑地說，自己跟在 Inspector 身邊學到的一件事，就是「太過自信，最後十有八九會被老媽拿魔法平底鍋敲腦袋」。想要抓住這隻狼，知道他下一個目標是誰才是關鍵。就在兩人討論該如何推測時，一旁突然傳來一聲「哎呀！」，原來是有人沒注意看路踩到了小男孩。那個人連忙道歉，正是你之前在樂座區遇見的 samurai──Shigure。這回他向被踩到的小男孩連聲致歉，保證自己並非習慣亂踩路人，只是滿腦子都在想調查的事。Nashu 很快就認出他，喊著「你就是上次那個 samurai，Shiggy 什麼來著？」讓 Shigure 一時不上不下。他慌忙澄清自己並不是常常把行人當踏板，只是這次又為了案子心不在焉。Nashu 想起他也在追查 Wolf Burglar，立刻問他有沒有新的線索。</p>
<p>Shigure 略微遲疑之後，坦承自己最近打聽到一個消息：城裡即將舉行一場私人拍賣，主題是來自各地的稀有外地貨。這種拍賣在 Kugane 並不算特別罕見，但這段時間 Wolf Burglar 一直沒有動靜，而坊間又傳出這次的拍品裡包含某些「特別驚人」的物件，對於喜歡挑戰的賊來說，實在是太誘人了。他正打算前往現場觀察情況，因此必須抓緊時間。正當他準備告辭時，Nashu 追上前去問：「那我們也可以一起去嗎？」Shigure 有些為難地答道，那是給富人參加的拍賣會，就算讓你們進去，也很難負擔得起裡面的物品。此時 Nashu 突然胸有成竹地說：「別擔心啦，Forename 有錢到可以買下你一千次再賣出去一千次。」Shigure 聽得目瞪口呆，卻也不好當場否認，最後只好半信半疑地接受，說既然如此，那就請你們一同前往。於是他領著你們來到 Kogane Dori 的一處包場場地，說明這裡今晚被預訂為私人拍賣會場，賓客很快就會陸續到來。在人群中，Nashu 一眼就看見 Master Akebono。對方見到你們時略感意外，打招呼說沒想到會在這種場合再見到「inspectors」。他推測你們大概是來防著 Wolf Burglar 的，順口提到如果看到喜歡的東西，現場也有 money changer，可以幫忙處理外國貨幣。只是話鋒一轉，他笑著警告：如果你們和他看上同一件東西，那就得做好一決勝負的準備，因為他可是不輕易退讓的人。</p>
<p>拍賣會在一名 Silver-tongued Broker 流利誇張的開場白下正式開始。他向在座的「富裕而尊貴的各位」致意，保證今晚將有來自世界各地的奇珍異寶輪番登場，只要你願意出價，就有機會帶回家。第一件登場的拍品，是在 Yanxia 山區捕獲的一隻「古怪畸形的魔物」，被 Broker 形容為傳說中的「ratman」，是人與獸的不淨結合體，據說只要吃下它的肉，就能獲得永恆的生命。他豪氣地宣布起標價為五十萬 koban，隨即引來一連串熱烈的叫價。最後還是 Akebono 以八十萬 koban 的高價搶下這第一件拍品，引起場內一片驚呼。站在旁邊的 Nashu 看得膽戰心驚，小聲嘀咕著：「他不會真的打算把那個可憐的 Qiqirn 吃掉吧……」拍賣隨即進入下一項，Broker 宣布接下來的「雕像」來自西方土地 Eorzea，並聲稱用「statue」來形容它實在太可惜，因為這件作品遠不止於此。他隆重推出「The Eoruzean Gentleman」，說那是西方雕塑的傑作，甚至有人說它栩栩如生，彷彿真正的人被定格在時間之中。當覆蓋其上的布帛被掀開時，Nashu 瞬間倒吸一口氣。眼前的雕像和 Inspector Hildibrand 幾乎一模一樣，就連姿勢與表情都讓人無法否認她的直覺。她忍不住猜測，會不會是哪位狂熱粉絲特地雕刻了這座作品。</p>
<p>然而 Shigure 皺起眉頭，說自己彷彿看到雕像微微抽動了一下。Nashu 聽了立即腦洞大開，斷定這絕對不是普通雕像──很有可能是 Inspector 本人被某種時間魔法凍結住，才會看起來像石像。既然如此，她理所當然想到的解決方案就是：「炸藥」。她一邊說一邊摸出裝滿炸彈的可疑包裹，打算用一發華麗的爆炸把 Inspector 從「石化」中解放出來。Shigure 見狀立刻攔下她，表情嚴肅地提醒，這裡人潮密集，一旦爆炸，無辜的賓客恐怕會被直接送上黃泉。Nashu 停了一下，承認「把一群無辜人一起炸飛好像真的有點不太像 inspector 會做的事」，只好勉強把炸藥收回包裹裡。這一邊她和 Shigure 在爭論，另一邊場內的目光也開始聚焦在那座雕像的表情變化上。Akebono 和胖乎乎的富豪小聲討論，說剛才似乎還沒這麼驚恐，原本記憶中的神情應該更平靜一些。Silver-tongued Broker 在壓力下只好急中生智，宣稱各位眼光敏銳，事實上這並不是普通雕像，而是一種前所未見的「雕塑與 automaton 混合體」，能夠以流暢自然的方式改變表情，正是它的獨特之處。說完這段勉強自圓其說的說詞，他再次高喊起標價為五十萬 koban，鼓勵賓客踴躍出價。拍賣進行得如火如荼，Akebono 再度站上主角位置，一次又一次加價，步步緊逼其他競爭者。</p>
<p>Nashu 看著這一切，越想越是焦急。照這樣下去，Inspector Hildibrand 真的會被當成藝術品賣給出價最高的人。你或許試圖插手加價，但無論如何，Akebono 最終還是仰頭大笑，豪邁地宣布：「這世上沒有我買不起的東西！出價一百萬 koban！」會場一陣驚呼，拍賣眼看就要落槌定案。就在此時，一陣咳嗽聲與騷動打斷了流程，眾人目光紛紛轉向舞台。當喧鬧平息下來，「The Eoruzean Gentleman」卻已不見蹤影，原本放置雕像的地方空空如也，只剩下一張熟悉的字條：──「You have just been robbed by the Kugane Wolf Burglar!」Shigure 當場大罵那傢伙是「被詛咒三次的 oni」，氣得咬牙切齒，因為賊就在他眼皮底下再次得手。Akebono 一邊咳嗽一邊喘氣，說自己看到了那個長著狼一般面孔的賊，背起雕像便朝 The Short Pier 方向狂奔而去。Nashu 則用她一貫的方式消化這個消息，驚呼：「這代表 Inspector Hildibrand 被偷走了──不對，是被綁走了！」她腦中立刻浮現剛才那隻被當成「ratman」販賣的 Qiqirn，忍不住嚴肅起來，說對方或許也打算把 Inspector 當成食材，這一切無論如何都不能坐視不管。於是她二話不說衝向碼頭，要追上那名 Wolf Burglar。</p>
<p>來到 The Short Pier，Nashu 還是難以置信地搖頭嘆氣，說就連 Inspector Hildibrand 也不曾被人「偷走」過，這可是頭一遭。一名看起來有點不耐煩的船長 Curt Captain 把剛才目擊的狀況又講了一遍：一名 Lupin 背著一個扭曲得像是人形嘲諷的雕像，登上小船往 Ruby Price 的方向駛去。Shigure 早一步抵達現場，確認這與自己的情報吻合。對他而言，這次 Wolf Burglar 的大膽行徑既令人生氣，也成為可用的線索。他指出，敢在大白天、眾目睽睽之下偷走這麼顯眼的獵物，意味著賊在各處留下了一道供人追蹤的痕跡。只要順著這條路線追下去，就不至於立刻失去目標。於是他主動提議，大家應儘快前往 Ruby Price 追蹤。Nashu 抬頭看著遠方那座聳立的高塔，喃喃道那座塔「好像一直長到天上去」，隨後想到 Inspector 還在賊的手上，立刻收起感嘆，加快腳步跟上。</p>
<p>抵達 Ruby Price 時，Nashu 仍然忍不住抬頭看著高塔，感慨那真是「一層又一層地往上長」。Shigure 則把注意力集中在眼前的問題上，認為既然船一定得經過這裡，那麼在這裡駐守的人應該有機會看見背著雕像的 Lupin。他找上當班的守衛 Hayama 打聽，對方卻只能無奈地搖頭。自從 Garlean forces 從 Doma 和 Ruby Sea 撤退之後，往來的本地船隻變得非常頻繁，為了應付大量交通，上頭下達指示，要求對沒有明顯可疑之處的小型船隻簡化檢查，就這樣放行。Hayama 推測，你們要找的 Lupin 很可能只是眾多船隻中的一艘，在沒有任何異常可疑的情況下，他們根本沒有特別留意，更別說記得長什麼樣子。Shigure 感謝對方抽空說明，向他鞠躬道歉打擾，然後退回到你身邊。眼前這條線索暫時中斷，他不禁輕歎一聲，說看來這次無法在此地抓到賊的尾巴了。接著，他開始思考還有誰會長期注意這片海域，或許那裡才藏著下一個關鍵提示。不論是 Wolf Burglar 還是變成雕像被帶走的 Inspector Hildibrand，此刻都還在浪潮的另一端，但追蹤的腳步並不會因此停下，只是換了一個方向繼續前進。</p>
